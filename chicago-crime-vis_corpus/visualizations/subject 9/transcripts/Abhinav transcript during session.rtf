\outl0\strokewidth0 \strokec2 i'd like to know which of the four areas has the highest incidence of homicide battery sex offense kidnapping just I guess to know where to feel the most worried when I'm walking on the street\
What's the scale here, is it by area or number of people who live there or wokr there?\
how does area relate to number\
I need to know..do we have any numbers about population?\
so what is the police presence and how do we measure that?\
I don't want all crimes, I just wanted battary and assault\
And actually I would put river north back up on there\
Do we have any data on crimes that are solved?\
so can we do something with day of week?  just same crimes, battery and assault, same crimes\
so can I look at by time of the day and on the weekend?\
do you have data...that breaks down the neighborhood by smaller divisions or blocks\
UIC number of battary and assault cases by block?\
can you just get me the annual assault and battary cases?\
i'm just curious do we see the same trend for all crimes?\
Can we see this hotspot map by time?}
