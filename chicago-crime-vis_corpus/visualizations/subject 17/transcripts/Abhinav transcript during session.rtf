\outl0\strokewidth0 \strokec2 I am interested in ... if I was walking to the CTA train or walking to the EL...would there be any areas that are particularly dangerous to walk through...theft or battery or that sort of thing\
of the neighborhoods which one would have like personal property theft like breaking into an apartment or stealing my stuff...all that kind of stuff\
so my next question is...are...are umm...currency exchange and liquor stores as sketchy as they seem\
my next question..is um it seems like when I take the bus a lot in the summer it was worse...it was worse in the summer...so I'm wondering on the bus if there is more intoxication or fighting or verbal harrasment in summer months\
i think I would like to know the most frequent areas for sexual assault among these neighborhoods. A lot of people are worried about public places but also private places so it would be something good to know\
my next question..im worrie dabout child safety...if I was a police officer worried about children...im wondering what times of day I would like to focus and maybe near the school or closer to home if that makes any sense\
over the course of the time period that the dataset exsits...have there been changes in crime...i guess by neighborhood...have the neighborhoods experienced trends and crimes..i mean not all of the crimes but focused on robbery and murder probably would be one..homicide\
so my next question is...when you take the CTA they say there is no gambling on the CTA>..my question is ... is there gambling on the CTA?Near UIC...what's the ... I guess the most common ... what is the most dangerous thing and place at UIC...in the UIC area\
what types of crimes .. on the sidewalks and *...what types of crimes are happening at UICa\
lso lets choose the most...the top ones seem like...well lets see...im wondering is there days of th week (weekdays versus weekends), where this sort of common crimes in the UIC area are more or less\
what tpyes of violations are being committed around places of businesses...small businesses , grocery stores, gas stations, that sort of thing}
