<Explanation by Abhinav>

~6:50
#8: so I want to do each of these tasks in order?

7:10
#8: uh...  sure I will in a minute

7:19
#8: I need to communicate with the data expert?

8:04
#8: ok so I go up there now?

8:15
#8: hi can you hear me

8:17:
#8: good guess it works then

8:24
#8: what now?

8:30
ask anything?

8:35
like...?

8:55 
ok

9:05
so if i want to do the task of working out what areas {areas ... something} do I get to see crime stats?

9:22
can i get a {view of whole city} 

9:50
(looks between chat and desc.png)

10:10
<gets map> left finger to chin
stares at right of map

10:15
yeah that fine
uh, yes I can see the whats going on up here.
we got a lot up to here<gesture to right>

10:30
do we want to just look at areas in the middle of the city.
seems to be cutting out stuff on the <south?> side

10:40
oh, ok
<paces back between desc.png>

11:20
i see theres a lot of activity around here.
can we zoom in on the loop.
<gesture to area>

11:30
have we got any type of data on why type of activity there is in the loop

11:50
<paces between map and desc>

12:50
<bar graphs show up>
yea thats great thank you

13
these might be a bit easier to read if they were rotated
<tilts head to view>

13:21
seems like there just a lot of theft and battery
but thats <??> neighboorhoods just the loop

13:40 
we know that theft is the biggest problem around here
<goes to desc>

14
goes to bar chart
tilts head to read

14:15
can we see the.. the crime types for the other regions as well

14:25
its interesting that what happens in the loop is a different crime to what happens overall

14:40
so may want to deploy different officers to different regions
<goes to objectvies

14:50
<watches the map go away>
<stares at ???>
<back to desc>

15:30
<back to bar charts>

16:05
aha
<moves to new images>
--dk-- i have no clue whats on them

16:30
well this is obvious that theft is the big one
1640
but then again its probably not important as other forms of crimes

17:00
well, um.... well, where would you want to deploy the offices

17:15
thats quite <???> its spread amoung all regions, but...

17:25
lets have a look at this..
<goes to newer bar charts>
<pace between charts and color thing>

18:05
huh.. ok
<noticably angles body, not sure why>

18:40
ok we know that theft is the main issue, but depends on the < ????  ?? >
lets have a look at uh..

~18:50
yeah, lets have a look at the time of day.

~9:00
is there a graph showing theft for the time of day.

20:
actually is there a way that I can see for one day, the crimes, top 10 that have happened.

20:25
ok, thank you

20:35
<watches charts being moved>

20:40
huh
<stares at pie>

<looks at bar>

<has actally a sort of swivel movement for viewing>

21:45
<inaudible statement>

22:
<points at bar>

22:20
<new graph shows up>
its <?????> lines

22:40
I can't see the time of day on this graph here
<no motion, but stands in front>

22:50
so i want to see the type of crimes by time of day.
But ther eis nothing on there that shows the time of day or <????>
<looks at chat?>
ok

~23:40
<new bar chart shows up>
<paces between the different charts and desc>

24:20
give me the same of this<points at left most bar chart>, with the <???> practices, <???> damages and assault please 

22:50
<goes back to shrunk graphs, at this point off screen>

25:10
<goes to desc>

26:20
aha, oo thats very different
--dk-- I believe that he saw it because the chart was waved around

26:40
that makes sense
seems like most activites go up between noon and 6
except for battery

27
so maybe that a type of crime that can be prevented in this way

27:05
lets take a look at
oh, wait
lets take a look at theft

27:20
can we see a breakdown of theft throughout the week

28:45
yeah thats great
this is quite interesting
could we see a breakdown of the week for all crimes

29:50
<goes to the older charts>

30:25
paces between all of them

30:40
oh thats a lot of stuff <???>

30:50
oo i like this one, this one is nice
<points at line chart>

31
thank you <reference to expansion>

31:20
<squats to view the bottom>

31:35
definitely these ones down here

31:45
alright quite significant, theft is quite huge here

32
lets see <????> saturday <???> people out and about <??> damage

32:10
<???> over here we have, yeah can pretty much see everything up here
dont need this one here<points to right chart>

32:??
k, lets have a look at
can we have this graph over here for <???> year
<hand open at line chart>

32:55
<watches a chart get moved to right, follows>

33:05
aha great

33:15
oh, i guess that makes sense, people <???> away for the winter

33:45
<????> seems like a general odd year
<???> battery supplies <???>

34:05
may to october time

34:15
this would show a lot of the crime patterns.

34:25
how about a break down of the crime for each year

34:55
<paces>
<stops at older charts>

35:30
its good to see that crime <????>
how about this one here?

35:40
this would be purple, what kind of purple

35:55
<???> has gone down


36:05
ok, lets have a look at.
how are we gona look at hot spots

36:25
are there any other kind of heat maps other than this one here?
<points at an older chart>

37:00
are there any other kind of maps we can see, or is there the only kind we have?

37:20
<???> can we get the heat map of thefts

37:50
<paces>

38:05
<chuckles, unsure at what. possibly because the maps are... fluctuating in size?>

39:10
k, can we see the same, but with <???> practices
<left hand over right large map>

39:40
<right index finger out and tracing something on the map>

40:00
well there definitely a <???> right there
<right index finger out at somethign>

40:15
k, well i'm not going there anymore


40:50
so if we get <???>

41:10
ok, lets see if we can knock some of these off, so which areas to deploy offices

41:20
I think its <???> what has the the highest crime

41:40
actually can we see all crimes or <???> of crimes <??> each area

42:00
<???> is well thats <???> very high of, of theft

42:20
well we wanna tackle theft
bring those numbers down 
go off of that um, day of that
we got some nice <??> of <??>

42:30
ok this one down good <??> that was friday saturday.
lot happens there

42:40
ok thank you
yeah, yeah <??> thats the one want to look at

after the the year was during the summer months thats things

<???>
high for theft but everything else quite stable

43:00
hot spots we do see
one nasty hot spot there for deceptive activity
and around lik e <???> street is quite
alot of theft there
suprised that we didn't have more off

it didn't quite make much sense there
<??> is a hotspot

significant change is that it seems to have gone down over the years
great
ok, <??> that what <???> appears to be doing?
43:50


44:00
yeah, <??> some of its <??>
actually the sum <???> good look
could get into a lot more

44:15
I think it depends on how much time I want to go into this

44:30
is half hour good?

44:40
actually that was closer to an hour wasn't it?

44:50
take this off?

45:05
mmhmm
was it just one page or <??>


45:20
ok.

<--dk-- at this point there was the open discussion about the experience, the problem was that I had a really hard time making out any clear words. Fairly certain #8 took their mic off. > 

1:04:50
yeah

1:04:55
there's a lot of good and bad
the thing that gets <??> me first was that
usually when you have an application <???>

5:07
<???> desktop and analysis <???>
<???> ask you something? I don't what
and that was tricky I wasn't sure what to say
I wasn't quite sure what to say
I wanted to do a nice time laps with images, but <???>
and that was quite tricky and <???>

<???>
I was actually looking at em.
<goes to board says something, laughts>
<inaudible>
1:05
If I don't want something <???> go away
<???>
yeah

6:40
Oh, you can do that, I didn't know you could do that
<inaudible>

6:50
it was something I wanted to keep around but it went over there
<??>
go over there
either a mix of natural language and guestures

7:30
so you got these two maps here, I wanted to <???> in this map here
<inaudible>

8:10
and I <??> that <???> it would be more

8:20
but I also wanted to see what,
over here you got <???>
oops

8:40
so you got a lot of stuff down there <???>

8:50
<inaudible>

9:00
so now the thing is that, the thing is that <???>

9:10
so this, this <???> down here
<??>
it wasn't quite as pronounced as <??>
it seems about dark over here

9:40
nah, but that <??> doesn't it?
<???> a bit
I would imagin it would be a bit darker
this should be a bit darker

10:00
if the total is a bit darker than <???> then the component <??>
10:20
this should be darker than thefts

10:30
it will add <???> but
<inaudible>

10:50
so i would <???> but that <??> would be something else 
would be darker
but i coudln't see that <??>

11:05
an this one which was desceptive
<inaudible>
well, is it really...

11:20
but that one there, that one's scary
its like where all the <????> is
its a red line

12:00
<inaudible>


12:40
This is bridge <??> 20
And this one is 24

13:00
<inaudible>


13:20
not really, they're great for business <????>
its not quite, <???> trend
so you can see here that is really busy

13:40
<inaudible>
<more inaudible>

14:50
<inaudible>
but it would be nice to get <???>

15:40
<inaudible>
what does the person do?
<inaudible>


17:30
<???> getting worse, getting better <???>

21:20
<mostly inaudible talk about zoom on a map, related to isolation and enlargement of data points, compared to "zoom" in>


1:27:14
<all audio seems to die at this point, however loud buzz still remains. But either way, could barely understand what was being said at this point>
