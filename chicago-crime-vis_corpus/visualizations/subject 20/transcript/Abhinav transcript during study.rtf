\outl0\strokewidth0 \strokec2 can i see the crimes by day of the week for UIC?\
for the same spread, that is day of the week, can i have another visualization by the side of this one which tells me all about public peace violation\
can i get a visualization of all the major crime types..for again UIC area?\
all crime involving theft all around teh UIC area for all the location types\
Now I would like to extend this...to see if it is a common thing to all the four neighborhoods...or particulate to this...so I would like to see that\
one more inquiry i was thinking of is...can you bring up the image that has been covered\
now i would like to see the spread of theft and battery for all the neighborhoods during different days of the week\
maybe i would like to see the srpead around different months\
can you just pull 6-1 and 7-1 into focus?\
I'di'd like to see another visualization that will tell me all the different crime types that are there in newest\
can i get a visualization of all the crimes that happen in the area for the location type that is street?\
can i get a spread of this data across the year?\
can you single out theft alone and give that data for a year...when I say year can I get by day spread over the year?\
can you ive me the same visualization for UIC area?\
sorry computer crashed\
is it possible to further divide the data into ... or order them somehow...in the time they occur in these days?\
a single line that would..how do i say this..ok on the x-axis each day into the hour of the day....i dont know if thats too much data to a graph..does it make sense..is it clear?\
day 1..four bins...day 2 four bins...on the x-axis and number of crimes on the y-axis...is that possible?\
