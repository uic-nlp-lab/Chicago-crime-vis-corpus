\outl0\strokewidth0 \strokec2 show me the months where the most number of crimes occur around the school area\
I'm thinking that schools are in session for certain number of months of the year and out for certain number of months of the year and i'm wondering which crimes are prevelant in session versus out of session\
wath's happening at the beginning of the chart, where all the bars are high?\
so there is no age-related data here?\
so can we narrow in on June through september theft data and where it's happening?\
waht's the difference between a street and a sidewalk\
is there times of day when street theft from june through september is happening more frequently...what is the time of day look like for that street data?\
so is there a way to show how many officers were on these particular streets? ... The number of crimes per hour ... the darker the red on the other map the higher the concentrations....is this correct?\
so if the theory is that we need more officers on the street..we need to know typically how many officers are on the street at time of day and let's say we just pick this north and randolph area\
(between noon and midnight)\
so let's see...umm...let's see where else we can go...so by year...oh this is interesting...we are only looking at one year..are there other years we can look at for this exact same picture?\
Oh yeah...let's break it out by year\
ok can we do that same picture that we did for theft...can we do it for battery?\
what can we infer to explain the drop...do we have data that tells us anything about that?\
so when i'm looking at this..I still...see a good trend....things are going down...can we pick an actual location and look at the crime around that location?\
let's pick madison and state area\
and state and lake\
state and washington..and state and madison...\
what is at those two dark red spots? wheat's there?\
let's take a year by year picture of the crime data thats happening in those two spots\
can we look at the purple line on theft at the hotspot...so can we do overlay of 2010 between january and december...so we can compare year to year on theft\
let's see what we can find out about chicago avenue and michigan avenue ...right there..magnificent mile...\
show me that hotspot lets see what kind of crime is happening there\
can we see crime for one of these months by location type? Let's pick a month....let's pick month of november .. and let's just pick a year..and what the location types was for the year...and you can do it by year or clump them all together\
does the city have to police the department store or does the department store have to bring in more private cops to watch the stores?\
If I was cynical what department stores have the most crime and what are their insurance policy rates?\
we can highlight where the largest numbe rof crimes occur\
we can see predominantly the most crime is theft\
let's bring back all of our crimes, the crime type, yes yes that one\
that's a good one\
take out theft and just do homicide and battery and put them in the same picture and let's see who pops up...so we'll have a 0 to 6k scale and see more of a relative\
let's look at the years 2011 to 2013 for homicide and the location types where the crimes occurred\
so can you take these two pieces of data...street and apartment...in 2011 to 2013 and show them on the map?\
so what kind of data can you show me about this bright red dot right here...?\
it looks like its just north of lake\
and maybe morgan?\
and are they all the same two events?\'a0\
