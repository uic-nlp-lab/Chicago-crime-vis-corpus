so could you show me any graph or visualization\
\
Can you show me burglaring for I mean burg..aaa\'a0(Graph appears in screen) ah ok\
\
Can you wide them it. (Graph is made bigger) I mean horizontally on the x axis\
\
so this is basic specifically for 4 neighborhoods, crime is 2010 to 14 and can you show me the distribution of the crimes with respect with the crime types?\
\
In this case River North has the maximum crime reported, after that its Near West and then UIC and L seems to be the safest out of this 4.\
\
So can you show me the crime distribution in river north\
\

\f0\fs24 \cf0 \expnd0\expndtw0\kerning0
\
(new graph appears)\
Ok it seems that the crime distribution is from all neighborhoods but I would like to see the crime distribution specifically from river north. (looks at the chatterbox) a it is working on it now.\
\
In the second graph meanwhile the third graph comes its theft seems to be the most common crime followed by battery but there is a huge difference in the numbers between theft and then battery and then on.\'a0\
\
(new graph)\
\
So this is specifically for river north it seems to follow the same pattern. (\'85) The crime pattern reported over all neigh. the same pattern you can see in RN. So can you only show the bar graph or there is another way of visualizing the same... (hears typing in the box stops to read)\'a0\

thank you\
\
(new graph)\
\
ok, So here in this graph, sorry this visualization theft seems to cover the major area so, so it corresponds to the same thing so ok in UIC its also theft in L ok\'85and the next ok\
\
(new graph)\'a0\
\
ok, so what is this other graph for? is the same, different graph for the same? (looks at chatterbox)\

\f0\fs24 \cf0 \expnd0\expndtw0\kerning0
a ok another view. and if we see here the\'85 ok.. so can we remove this graph (pointing left arm and index finger) and just can we refocus on the other one (points with right arm) (graph is centered and made bigger)\
\uc0\u8232 \
ok this seems to be a better one and here if we see L we have theft and then the second highest is then defective practice. Where at here it is theft, in north west is theft and battery in river north is theft and battery and then deceptive practice. And if \'a0we see in NW deceptive practice is not being reported that much. But in UIC again theft and battery and then comes criminal damage. So if we need to focus in which crimes to target well in general it seems theft and battery this two should be considered the priority. And what do you think?\
\uc0\u8232 \

\f0\fs24 \cf0 \expnd0\expndtw0\kerning0
yes, amm, ok and ok. Can you show me now for each year the crime distribution in the four neighborhoods?\
\uc0\u8232 \
meanwhile one more question. which crime types to target? are we looking neighborhood wise or in general? ahh\'85\
\uc0\u8232 \
(two more graphs)\
\uc0\u8232 \
ok. So in 5-2 ahhh 05-2 image, we can see that am the crime rate with respect with each progressing here. We see that in a good way from 2010 to 2014 we can see there is reduction in the crime rate in all the four neighborhoods aaa in 2014. and ok. and aaa What exactly is 05-1graph about?\'a0\

\'a0\
ah yes! ok and we can also make out from this graph that the highest crime as we saw in the first graph. Amm.. ok, Can you bring the 01. yes. So here we see that or the entire time frame (\'85) so which area to deploy the officers?... so here we have RN and then comes NW which according to this graph... if we see year wise, there \'a0is a decrease in the crime rate. Even though the total reported number of crimes is second highest but if we see UIC, ok UIC and then comes(...) \'85 if we want to deploy more officers the area of neighborhood of concern would be first 1 is river north and second one is UIC.\

\
but, ok can you show the month wise i mean \'a0for 2014 month wise crime reported in each\'a0neighborhood?\
(2 new graph appears)\
so in, if we see with 06-2.png \'a0in loop the highest crime is reported in\'85 August, yes august, \'a0in near west is reported in... June and July... but august... ok and \'a0what about here in June and July, yes so and here June July august again there is a peak we can observe in river north and in UIC is pretty high in October and also pretty high in July and august and the crime reported, amm in January in winter January February March, I mean and December so I think in winter (\'85) the crime reported ok, so the crime is reported more during the summer time summer and Fall so almost like June July August, the same is applicable in NW we see a peak during the summer time and is compared, comparatively less during the winter time that is basically December, January,m February but... the crime reported in RN its\'85 \'a0its high the entire year and in UIC again is comparatively less during the winter time aaa like November December January February but is high during the main that is summer and Fall time ok\'85\'a0\
and in this 06-1 what exactly is this? is January ok (\'85) we can see from all this graphs that River North if the crime rate is high in all the months and ok so here in January February March which one is\'85 ok .. so is less than its time 1, 2 ,3 ,4 this 2 months o sorry this 2 months is July and August.(...) So the pattern we can make out from this 2 graphs is basically that... what I said earlier is the crime reported during summer and Fall time is higher compared to the winter time, ok and so.. that is according to the month and what about the crime rate reported according to day of the week, can you show me a visualization for that?\

\b \expnd0\expndtw0\kerning0

\b0 \expnd0\expndtw0\kerning0
\
(new graph)\
ok thats by days of week? so in 07-2 we see that, ok in River North again Saturday and Sunday. So weekends are I mean the crime... crime reported in weekends almost Friday, Saturday Sunday is higher than the weekdays, normal weekdays, working days, we can see a distinct I mean clear I mean pattern in River North aaa specifically River North aaa neighborhood. There is not distinct such distinctive pattern in UIC is that the crime reported is uniform in all 7 days of the week except Friday and in Near west its Again the crime reported if we see its more from Fri Sat Sun that is more like during the weekend time than the week days and in L is totally different because in L as people work there would be more people present in (...) during the week days rather than the weekends so the crime reported it seems to have a different kind of pattern than the rest of the neighborhoods where you can see that the crime reported is more, is higher during the week compared to the weekends, weekends which include Saturday and Sunday.\
\uc0\u8232 \
ok. I somehow feel the 06-2 and 07-2 there are much clearer to visualize and understand rather than 06.1 07.1 yea we can should ssssup\'85 \'a0so what we can make up from the previous graph in here is that the months in the summer and fall months I mean the summer and fall season and then particularly with respect to days is in near west RN and UIC the crime is more reported during the weekends rather than the weekday but in L is the other way around is the time reported is more during the weekday rather than the weekends. So and what about the crime of the day? like crime reported with respect the time of the day?\
ok so here it is\'85 ok first will focus on RN. So the crime reported is more from the highest in the afternoon time from noon to 6pm and then the second one is 6pm to midnight and what about UIC it also haves a similar pattern with respect to noon to midnight ok and we see a similar pattern in nearWest that the crime reported is higher from noon till midnight and in L is again noon is the same pattern noon to midnight the only difference in the pattern we can see in the pattern is (..)\'a0
\f2\fs28 \expnd0\expndtw0\kerning0
the lower crime occurs in UIC from midnight to six am in NW its midnight-to-six am in Loop its midnight\'a0to6 am but. In River North the crime rate is \'a0from 6 am to noon ok so \'a0here we have month, day and time to look for \'a0okay this is for your day so can you show me these three corresponding graphs that is the respect to month on days of the week and year for years 2010 11 12 13 and 14

in 2010 RN again you can see crime reported is higher in \'a0The\'a0Weekends\'a0so on Friday Saturday and Sunday in 2011 (..)\'a0I\'92m again \'a0talking about RN in 2012 its again Friday Saturday Sunday. in\'a02013 is Friday Saturday and Sunday in \'a02014 again Friday Saturday and Sunday here crime reported in R north in sunday exceed maximum vs Saturday is Friday (..) it's Saturday on Saturday its maximum but the crime reported on Friday and Sunday its growing over the years. ok thats for 14 is RN and if we consider UIC is\'a0maximum on friday I mean and here in Friday in 11 in 12 again friday in 13 its friday 14 is friday so the max. crime reported in UIC is on Friday and the rest of the days they do but not to a very extent its seems to be very uniform so if we see in NW again\'a0crime reported from Friday till sunday . For all this years from 14 and in Loop is more during the weekends from\'a0today till friday 2011,2012,13,14 so ok so from days of the week we can identify a pattern from here 10-14 that in neigh. RN UIC the crime reported is max from \'a0 F till S where as in loop is the other way around the crime reported is highest during the week days.

43:00
\f0\b0\fs24 \expnd0\expndtw0\kerning0
\
\'a0 so ok and now lets focus on the day timings! time of the day we will begin with RN is max from Noon to midnight its the same history in 2011, noon to midnight noon to midnight, noon to midnight and noon to midnight ok. and In UIC and ok so (\'85) UIC its again noon to midnight over all the period... years in NW again is noon to midnight over the years and but in loop as we seeeee, ok noon to midnight noon to midnight noon to midnight but in loop its maximum in 2010 is noon till 6pm noon to 6 pm noon to 6 pm in 2012 noon to 6pm in 2013 and 2014 its noon till 6pm,ok so again here we can see a distinct pattern \'a0we also saw a distinct pattern during the days of the week \'a0but also during the time of the day (...) there is a similar pattern in 3 suburbs NW RN and UIC and L has a different kind of pattern. so we see crime reported is highest during noon to midnight in NW RN and UIC and in L its during noon to 6pm. ok\'85.ok\'85.so\'85..and\'85.about the month\'85for ok so we already have hear for hear for the month\'85.its RN its during highest is during July august in 2010 same history in 2011 but in 2012 even august has higher crime rate reported ok and here is june. There is variation\'85. ok can we align the 2013 graph? its easier. I mean can we align graphs amm a the month\'85ok. Yea thats better.\'a0\
\uc0\u8232 \
Ok, so here its in July and August in 2010 and here it is July and August where as here also June but July and August are still the highest crime reported where as here ok sorry. ah this is which one. July and August mmm ok but year november, december, november december, jan compare november december jan feb. Crime is lowest during February but hi. during June July August in this 3 months. ok thats for RN. And for UIC its more\'85.\
Graph expands and goes to middle of screen...\
o where did the graph go? ok sorry.. Can you minimize it? can you put it the place it was. Ok March October and here ok ok February ok. So for crime February seems to be the less favorable month, but the most favorable month for crime is basically the summer time, summer and a little bit fall so we can say the major is from around, no even \'a0march till September so that could be peak time. So in case if we want to vary the deployment depending on the time of the day days of the week month of the year. Then for all the neighborhoods respect to month the deployment should be more from months march till aa September aaa then with respect to days of the week in RN sorry in RN, NW and UIC the deployment should be \'a0more during the weekend that specially from Friday till Sunday where as in L the deployment should be more during the weekdays and with respect to time of the day if we are focusing to vary the deployment the NW, RN and UIC during aaa noon till midnight aaa one needs to place.. deploy more officers where as in L it should be between noon till 6pm \'a0in that time more officers must be deployed. Thats what I can make out from all this graphs over here of 2010 till 2014 and which areas to deploy the officers? so with respect to this 4 neigh. the crime rate seems to be highest in RN so I already told in my answer it should be RN and also UIC because thats what we can make from the graph that \'a0aa the crime rate is still high in aa RN and UIC compared to the other 2 neigh.\'a0\
