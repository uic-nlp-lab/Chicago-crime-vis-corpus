\outl0\strokewidth0 \strokec2 is there any way to keep all this stuff up while we look at a different neighborhood?\
Could I look at River North for the same graphs that you gave me?\
actually if you could make the GPS map a little bit bigger\
is there any way to show the street names on the UIC GPS map?\
is there any way I can take notes on this?\
Could you bring up 0.2.2\
is there a total crimes for all four neighborhoods?\
can i take these off the screen or minimize and put the next two neighborhoods\
yeah can you do the same thing for river north?\
can we have all the maps centrally together so I can compare\
can you place them all side by side again?\
could I see the crime type side by side too?\
ok can i start answering what I would do for my task?\
