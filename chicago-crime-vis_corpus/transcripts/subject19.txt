Wait can I have the four areas again?
experimentor: Yeah what do you want to know?
The four areas.
experimenter: *Oh* yeah it's U_I_C--
*Oh* I can ask her.
experimentor: Yeah you can ask her.
What are the four areas?
Ok thanks.
*Um* [medium] can you-- *um* are you able to show-- [medium] like the-- [medium] like the entire percentage of crime-- *um* in each neighborhood? 
*Oops*.
Sorry I meant like how many crimes occur [short] that's what I meant.
00:7:25
*Oh* oops. 
*Um* is this the amount of crime per year?
For all four years ok.
*Um can you show me the population of each neighborhood? [short]
Sorry [short] *um* [medium] can we look at-- ok at *um* the Near-West side first and are you *um* able to differentiate what types of crimes they were *um* of the 46,000?
8:49
So for Near-West-Side it was mostly theft, then batt-- battery xxx.
*Um* [medium] of the theft [short] in the Near-West-Side, are you able to kind of *um* show it by-- by month?
00:10:17
*Oops*. [short]
*Oh* it's not that [short] different. 
Let's see.
*Um* can you do the same thing for battery [short] in the Near-West-Side?
That's right here.
So it's decreasing?
experimentor: Remember to see-- explain what you see when we get new visualizations.
Ok, well it seems a little bit low in February but it doesn't seem drastically different from the summer months to some of the winter months and it is decreasing from 2010 to 2015. [long]
00:11:16
So it's a little bit higher in the warmer weather but *um* [short] not that much [short] and it's *um* kind of a downward trend over the years.
*Um* can you do the same thing for-- can you do *um* [short] the number of crimes *um* [short] the same thing you did for the Near-West-Side for the other three neighborhoods [short] U_I_C, River-North, and *um* [short] the-- the Loop?
*Oh* and when-- I'll come back to it but I was wondering where the *um* location of the thefts in Near-West-Side? [medium]
Sorry.
xxx theft, battery xxx.
Number of crimes [short] per month in West only-- [short] *oh* no, in each neighborhood.
Theft, battery, criminal-damage. 
*Um* [short] robbery, motor-vehicle, theft. 
Homocide is really [short] almost non-existant.
*Um* [medium] *oh* can you show me the location of theft and *um* [short] battery in the four neighborhoods?
00:15:25
So street is the highest [short] of all four neighborhoods, [short] then side walk, *um* department-store, restaurant, other, residence, [medium] parking-lot, retail-- small-retail-store.
*Um* [long] can you show the time-of-day [short] *um* [short] of theft and battery in all four neighborhoods when-- when it mostly occurs?
00:17:05
*Um* are you able to show [short] where the crimes occur *um* between noon and 6 and 6-P_M and midnight?
experimentor: What's wrong it's not working? 
experimentor: No audio? 
experimentor: *Uh* that's interesting, it just turned off that's all.
*Oh* sorry.
experimentor: Ok now it's working.
*Um* can you show the-- *uh* [short] the location-type for *um* [short] the crimes that occur between noon and 6 and 6-P_M and midnight?
00:21:17
*Um* [short] we're not able to get data based on xxx.
experimentor: Hey, can you check if it's on again?
experimentor: Is it green light?
Am I pressing-- I'm holding it, It's on now.
experimentor: It is?
Yeah but the green light-- I didn't press it and it just turned off, it must have muted.
Alright-- *oh* [short] is it low on battery?
experimentor: Yeah I'll get a new battery.
It's turning red. 
Can you hear me still? 
*Oh* *um* are you still-- wait for the battery ok.
Ok *um* [medium] ok. 
*Um* you guys don't have data on the criminal do you?
The person who is committing the crime?
Ok, are you able to split these up between noon and 6 and then one for 6-- 6 to midnight?
00:25:05
*Uh* is blue the new-- *oh*. [medium] 
Ok [short] and that's the comparison up there?
Ok.
So 6-P_M to midnight [medium] for all locations. 
*Oh* this is 6-P_M to midnight that's midnight to 6. 
Street, department-store, restaurant, retail [short] sidewalk, 6-P_M to midnight.
Department-stores are a lot higher at-- *oh* from noon to 6 obviously because they're open.
Street, sidewalk, restaurant, department-store, [short] and other. 
*Um* for-- *um* like individually for street, sidewalk, department-stores, and restaurants are you able to show-- *um* that's ok-- *um* are you able to show where on a map they occurred? Like where-- what streets, what sidewalks, what department-stores, and what restaurants?
*Oh* sorry.
*Um* [short] theft and battery all crimes, streets, department-stores, restaurants, sidewalks. 
*Um* *hm*.
For *um* [short] for noon to 6 for all crimes, *um* [short] can you show *um* for noon to 6 for all crimes for streets, department-stores, restaurants and-- like the one, two, three, for, top five locations are you able to do that by month?
Ok. Noon to 6, yup.
*Um* it kind of looks similar to the other month graphs. 
I think I see it. 
*Oh* no that's just Near-West-Side. 
Is that for all months or just Near-West-Side?
Nevermind-- do we have for all neighborhoods [short] the month?
*Oh* it looks somewhat similar. 
*Um* so for this *um* graph you made on-- on my left the top five locations can you just make it for *um* street and sidewalk the outdoor locations [short] by month?
*Oh* February is cold.
*Oh* it looks similar but it's *um* higher in the summer, lower in January, February, and Decemeber when it's colder, and it's a little bit higher in the fall and spring and highest in summer.
Can you do the same thing for *um* 6-P_M to midnight please?
6-P_M noon to 6. 
So it sort of follows the same trend, maybe except for October is a little higher, 6-P_M to midnight, but it's highest in the summer months and lowest in the winter months.
*Um* [short] let me think.
*Oh* the *um* can you go back *um* so I think you have a-- *uh* there's a graph that says number of crimes per month from *um* noon to 6 and 6 to midnight per month.
*Um* can you *um* delineate by neighborhood maybe? [medium] 
Or do we already have that graph?
00:35:44
*Oh* sorry I didn't realize the scales of the graph are different so there's *um* from 6-P_M to midnight there's definitely more crimes because it goes up to two thousand per month. And that one is 1500 from noon to 6.
So more outdoor crimes in the summer months from 6 to midnight, ok.
Noon to 6, 6-P_M to midnight. 
The highest in River-North.
So for River-North can you separate it from noon to 6 and 6 to midnight?
*Oh* it's similar. 
On the same graph could you *um* put in the two other time slots? *Oh* sorry xxx. So 6-A_M to noon is the least, in the middle of the night is in the middle, and then afternoon evening night are the highest.
*Um* am I supposed to make a conclusion?
Ok *um* do you happen-- *oh*.
Do you-- do you happen to know if law enforcement is trying to decrease a certain type of crime or *um* they are just looking at overall number of crimes?
Ok-- [short] ok well I was looking at theft and battery because it was the highest.
But *um* and-- do you happen to know if theft is mostly just like wallets being stolen or you guys-- or you don't have that data?
00:39:29
Ok *um* because I-- River-North has the highest number of crimes. *Oh* can you show me the number of crimes in *uh* River-North by year?
So in from [short] like 11,700 or so in 2010 down to *um* about 9-- is that-- about 9,000 in 2014. That's a big decrease.
*Um* you guys don't have any-- xxx? [medium]
*Um* so just looking at River-North, are you able to *um* show me the types of crimes there were in 2010 like the number of crimes in 2010 and the types compared to 2014?
00:43:38
This is just for River-- this is for all neighborhoods, ok.
2010. 6. 17,000. And then theft in 2014 was 12.
So theft has gone down. Battery has gone down just a little bit. *Um* deceptive-practice and criminal-damage kind of flip-flopped, and the other ones have gone down a little bit.
*Um* can you make this-- *um* this graph where you show the crime-types from 2010 to 2014 for *um* each of the four neighborhoods?
River-North, U_I_C, Near-West, and the Loop.
And the Loop hasn't really changed that much.
But the other four neighborhoods have decreased. 
*Um* kind of-- well they are in different-- 4,500.
The Near-West has decreased a considerate-- *uh* a big amount. 
So has U_I_C-- U_I_C has decreased a little bit. 
Near-West has decreased. 
But the Loop has stayed the same *um* in theft and gone up in deceptive-practice.
*Um* so since the Loop number of crimes has not gone down too much, can you show me for theft-- *um* [short] what *hm* let me think. *Oh* *um* for 2014 can you show me what day-of-the-week most theft occur?
So Friday and Saturday are the highest-- it's kind of like the weekend and the other five days are *um* about the same.
*Um* for Friday and Saturday can you show what times of the day the crimes occur? [medium] in 2014 sorry.
Is there a time limit?
*Oh* nevermind.
So most crimes on *um*-- this is for-- is this for *um* [short] just Friday and Saturdays or *um* every day-of-the-week?
Ok-- ok thanks. 
*Um* so it seems like most crimes on the first two days of the weekend are from noon to 6 and then second is 6 to midnight which is kind of *um* corresponds with some of the other data for times of the day.
And then I have one last question about the Loop *um* because it seems like there-- the one area where *um* certain crime hasn't decreased in like even deceptive-practices increased just a tiny bit.
*Um* can you show *um for the Loop for theft and deceptive-practice can you show *um* [short] what days of the week those crime occur for theft and deceptive-practice?
00:52:01
U_I_C. 
So it's highest on Friday, lowest on Sunday, and then kind of the same Monday through Thursday and Saturday.
*Um* for the Loop, *um* just for theft, can you show what-- show the crimes by month?
*Hm* higher in summer months, a little bit lower in winter months-- *oops*, kind of like some of the other monthly data.
