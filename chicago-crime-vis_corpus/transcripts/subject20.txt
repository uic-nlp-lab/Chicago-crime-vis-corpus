START
00:10:15
So *uh* [short] that's alright.
*Uh* I want to see [short] the general spread of the crime-type intimidation around U_I_C area [short] spread by day-- [short] day-of-the-week? [long]
Friday. [medium]
Ok *uh* [short] I was hoping to see a [short] big increase on Fridays but [short] let's see-- see if we can find something related to that.
*Uh* [long] for the same *uh* [short] spread that's of the day-of-the-week *um* [short] can I have another visualization by [short] *uh* [short] by the side of this one [short] which tells me all about *um* [short] public-peace-violation? [long]
00:12:45
Ok [short] *oh* [medium] not too many.
Ok *uh* thank you for the [short] second visualization *uh* I think I'm done with that.
Does-- I don't see much [short] information out of that. [short]
*Uh*. [long] 
Can I get a visualization of-- of [short] all the major crime-types? For, again, U_I_C area? [long]
14:15
Ok. [long] 
Alright. [short]
2400. [long]
I see that theft and battery are way more-- theft is obviously the highest and *uh*. [long]
Now I'd like to see [short] all crimes involving [short] the crime-type theft [short] around U_I_C for [short] all the different location-types? [long]
15:36
Quite a few more vehicle theft as well. [short] 
Ok. [long] 
Streets, [long] Grocery, food store. [medium] 
Ok, [long] street [short] grocery, food store. [short] 
Ok.
*Uh* [short] theft on streets [short] that's--. [long ] 
*Oh* wow, ok, [short] *haha* [short].
That-- That's ok. 
*Uh* but [short] even though the graphs [short] looks similar-- [short] the y-axis, ok. 
I get that. [short] 
*Uh* [short] theft, battery [short] criminal-damage. [short]
Ok. *Uh* [medium] I would-- I'm seeing that there's a lot of theft and there's [short] most-- most of them are happening [short] on streets.
*Uh* now I'd like to extend this [short] to see if this is a common thing across all the four neighborhoods or [short] if it is very [short] particular to this neighborhood.
So [short] I'd like to [short] see that. [long]
19:15
Ok *uh* [short] as I suspected [short] streets are the number one. [short]
*Uh* [long] could you-- [short] *oh* you have given me two other visualizations. [short] 
Can you *uh* in-- make them more legible? Like bigger? [long]
*Ah* [medium] *ah* that's much better. [long]
Thank you. [long]
Only amongst theft. [short] 
Theft is quite-- [short] ok.
*Oh* from this [short] *uh* diagram what I can conclude is [short] even though theft is the number-- number one it is particularly more in Near-West. [short] 
*Uh* I'll come to that-- I mean I'll-- I'll inquire about that in a bit.
*Uh* wh-- [short] and [medium] one-- [short] one more line of inquiry that I was thinking of is-- [long] could *uh* [medium] can you bring up this *uh* the pic that has been hidden? [medium]
Yes [short] ok *uh*. [medium]
Now I'd like to see [short] the spread of [short] two crime-types that is theft and battery [short] for all the neighborhoods [short] *uh* during different days of the week? [long]
24:38
Ok, [medium] alright. [short] Theft and battery. [short]
17K, [short] 13K. [long]
Ok, this is not [short] this view is not [short] very helpful in terms-- I mean [short] not the view *uh* but [short] I don't see any pattern-- [short] any significant [short] variations between the days.
So [short] *uh* maybe I sh-- I would like to look at *uh* [short] the spread across different months? [long]
Months of the year, [short] only months, [short] ok. [long]
River-North [short] is [short] way higher than [short] any other. [medium]
Ok, [short] *um* [medium] although I've seen the general trend of [short] crimes [short] having [short] a--[short] a rise around [short] May, June, July [short] it's still not too steep a curve to [short] be of any particular interest.
*Uh* *oh*, yes, the-- the response is [short] fine.
*Uh* [long] maybe [medium] streets, [short] *um*. [long]
Could you pull up 6-1 and 7-1 [short] *uh* into focus? [short] 
The image is 6-1 and 7-1, please. [long]
28:09
Near-West. [long]
Maybe I'm not reading the data right but *uh* [short] somehow [short] Near-West, [short] street, [short] crime-- I mean street theft [short] seems to be much large-- much more in 6-1 [short] and when I compare it here [short] that is the spread of days [medium] the color pro-- proportions don't don't match? [short]
*Uh* [medium] is-- [medium] ok. [long]
Because I see a lot of green in 7-1 whereas I see a lot of orange. [long]
Sure. [long]
*Ah* [short] ok *oh* [short] I think I [short] see what the problem is.
That is only specific to theft whereas this is for theft and [short] battery.
Yeah, I did not take that into account. [short]
Right. [long] 
All neighborhoods theft and battery, street, [short] theft, street, ok. 
It makes sense. [long]
Alright. [short]
Thank you.
That response is-- [short] it makes sense. [medium]
Alright so [short] Near-West. [long]
31:19
In order to [short] reduce the crime-rate [short] *uh* my-- [short] my intention of [short] *uh*-- intentions behind asking these [short] visualizations is [short] *uh* [short] an obvious thought that if you reduce the-- [short] if you help reduce [short] the crime that is most prevalent, then you bring down the crime-rate.
So *uh* I think toward's that, [short] I can conclude that [short] theft is the number one crime and it's [short] more in Near-West *uh*-- [short] and [short] with that I think I'd like to focus [short] more on Near-West. [short]
So [short] *uh* I'd like to see [short] another visualization that would [short] tell me the second and third or rather all the different crime-types that are [short] there in Near-West? [long]
Ok, so [medium] the graph is almost identical to that of [short] *uh* U_I_C area in terms of [short] what crime is more and what crime is-- [short] how much that is, yeah.
*Uh* [short] ok. [long]
*Uh* [medium] ok I'm [short] trying to [short] analyze if [short] theft happens in isolation or [short] does it happen with [short] any other crime [short] *uh* [short] let me [short] see if I can [short] somehow make the connection. [short]
*Uh* [long] Near-West. [short] 
*Uh* [long] I-- [short] ok. [short]
*Uh* [medium] *hm* street. [medium]
35:56
Can I get a visualization of [short] of-- [short] all the crimes [short] that happen in the Near-- *uh* Near-West area [short] *oh* [short] for one particular type [short] *uh* location-type that is street? [long]
Theft, [short] criminal-damage, [short] motor-vehicle-theft, [short] battery. [short]
Ok [short] *um* [short] I expected [short] theft and motor-vehicle-theft to be [short] somewhat [short] closely relate-- closely related but [short] *uh* [short] criminal-- seeing criminal-damage up there [short] was a bit surprising. [short]
*Um* [short] Yes, *um* this visualization-- [short] yeah this is what I expected. [short]
*Uh* [short] ok [short] so. [long]
Day-by-year, day-by-year. [short]
*Uh* can I get a spread of [short] this data across the [short] yeah-- *uh* [short] year? [short]
Ok. [long] 
Ok. [long]
39:11
2012. [short] 
*Hm* [short] ok. [long]
Could you single out [short] theft alone and [short] give that data [short] for a year *oh* when I say a year [short] can I give-- a get *oh*-- *oh* [short] by day [short] *uh* spread over the year? [short]
Ok, [long] ok, *uh*. [long]
There are [short] yes, this-- this response is-- [short] it-- it-- it helps.
*Uh* [short] May-- there's-- there are [short] a few peaks [short] and [short] I'm wondering if [short] these peaks have a [short] particular [short] pattern to them or [medium] do they happen over [short] some events? [short]
*Uh* [long] *ah* [short] thank you. [long]
Maybe this peak was around the fourth of July? [short]
*Uh* [short] ok interesting. [long] 
Ok, *uh*. [long]
2014, 2014. [long]
Thank you. 
This one is [short] it-- it clarifies things [short] much [short] more.
Ok, [short] June-22-nd. [short]
Ok, but [medium] if I take into account the [short] number of crimes that is the y-axis [short] of-- [short] even though June-22-nd is a [short] peak [short] it [medium] *uh* [medium] it would be [short] wrong for me to conclude that [short] it's [short] some kind of a [short] a pattern. [short]
Ok *uh* [short] ok. [long]
44:55
For the same *uh* graph [short] can I see [short] theft and [short] *uh*-- [short] and [short] criminal-damage as two lines overlapping like multiline-graph?
Ok, [medium] thank you. [long]
Ok, [short] thank you. 
Yes, this is what I was [short] *uh* looking [short] for. [long]
*Hm*. [long]
With a few exceptions, I [short] think [short] the ups and downs of both [short] the curves [short] roughly match up [short] when there's a dip [short] in one there's a dip in the other when there's a rise in one there's a rise in the other [short] with a few [short] offsets and stuff.
Ok, *hm* [medium] I--. [long]
Criminal-damage, [short] *uh*. [long]
Could you give me the same [short] *uh* [short] visualization for [short] *uh* U_I_C area? [long]
49:11
Ok, and that's sort of the peak. [long]
Again, [short] one [short] roughly follows the other. [short] 
*Uh* [short] ok. [long]
I was [short] hoping to see [short] an overall [short] rise and dip [short] pattern [short] in the U_I_C area that was [short] that-- that [short] is similar to [short] what I see in the Near-West but [short] that's not-- [short] I was-- [short] how-- [short] which tells me that [short] day of the year was [short] not [short] a common factor?
Ok, *uh* [medium] October 12. [long]
These [short] *uh*-- [short] these two graphs [short] tell me that [short] criminal-damage more or less follows the pattern of theft which makes me wonder [short] if [short] it was one crime being committed that was booked as two different [short] cases-- two different incidents? [short]
*Uh*. [long] 
Ok. [long]
Ok so-- [long] but [short] is-- [short] what I'm wondering is if-- [short] even though it [short] was a secondary-- I mean the-- the in this case, in this particularly-- a case criminal-damage [short] could have been the secondary [short] crime-type for [short] whatever crime happened there but [short] for some reason it was [short] made as a separate [short] *uh* primary [short] type itself? [short]
*Uh* [medium] because *um*-- *uh* with-- with a bit of offset [short] the-- the [short] dips and [short] ups they seem to match with one another [short] is what I can clearly see from these two [short] graphs. [medium]
Maybe [medium] *uh*, [long] ok. [long]
Could you add [short] battery to [short] this visualization? [long]
55:14
*Uh* [long] ok even though [short] some of the [short] patterns on this graph [short] for battery do line up with criminal-damage I think *uh* it's too [short] small a data set to-- [short] to attach any significance to the-- [short] to the similarity in the pattern. [short]
*Uh* [short] but yeah, criminal-damage and theft [short] *uh* [short] I see a [short] correlation of sorts. [long]
Do you have [short] time of the day available for this data set? [medium]
Ok, *uh* [medium] may I see [short] just theft and criminal-damage [short] *uh* [short] for [short] Near-West [short] during different [short] times of the day? [long]
Time of the day. [long] 
Yes, thank you. 
*Uh* [long] ok. [long]
Ok. [medium] 
There's a small [short] *uh* [short] similarity in the [short] pattern [short] *uh* especially-- [medium] yes, yes just the street please. [long]
01:00:25
Ok, in that case, [medium] that's ok. 
*Uh* [short] I see a small [short] similarity in-- in the way [short] these [short] things-- I mean these two different crime-types progress over or spread across different hours of the day [short] but since there is [short] aggregation [short] *uh* [short] it's [short] not [short] it's-- it's not that evident or it's not that conclusive [short] to say that [short] *uh* to-- to [short] clarify my suspicion-- my-- my suspicion about [short] the data.
*Uh* [long] for the graph on 18-2 [short] *uh* [short] is it possible to further [short] divide [short] the data into, [short] or order them somehow depending on the time-of-day that they occurred on these days? [short]
Ok. [long]
Just a minor correction to the request that I made. [short]
*Uh* I [short] just want to see [short] *uh* two types that is theft and criminal-damage-- criminal damage I don't want to see the third [short] *uh* crime-type.
Thank you. [long]
Sure [short] that's ok. [long]
Yes, thank you. [short]
*Oh* [short] *uh* they have theft and criminal-damage? [long]
*Hm*. [long] 
Ok. [long]
01:09:16
*Oh* [medium] *um* [short] yes, *uh* I mean. [medium] 
Ok, well what I want-- [short] what I actually wanted to see [short] *uh* was [medium] all the [short] crimes-- *uh* sorry *uh*-- all the theft crimes *uh* [short] in a single [short] line that would [short] *uh*-- [medium] how do I say this ok, *uh* on the x-axis of each [short] day [short] also fine-grained into [short] hour-of-the-day [short].
I don't know if-- if that's [short] *uh* too much data into a graph [short] but [short] *uh* [short] is that clear-- does that make sense?
Is it clear? [medium] 
Ok. [long]
Ok *uh* [medium] well *uh* [short] in these [short] I'd say the [short] bottom [short] *uh* two charts [short] are less helpful in that case and the upper two [short] are better. [medium] 
*Uh* [short] because [short] these provide me with [short] line-graphs of specific events and specific hours [short] *uh* even though [short] at this [short] *uh* I mean in--in this particular chart [short] since [short] the [short] lines talk about specific [short] trends for each hour-of-the-day [short] *um* [short] it's harder to see if-- even if there is any correlation because [short] *uh* [short] yeah, it's--it's just too spread out. 
But in this case, [short] even though [short] it [short] is spread out [short] *um* [short] I [short] think [short] the data somehow is [short] still somehow similar [short] *uh* [medium] because [medium] *uh*. [long] 
Ok *uh* [short] can you do this-- *uh* [short] each [short] on the x-axis [short] each day [short] maybe not spread into each [short] *uh* instance or the each of-- of the crime occurrence but maybe each day *uh* broken down into these four events [short] like [short] day one, four events, all coming one after another.
Then day two and so on [short] on the x-axis and [short] number of crimes on the y-axis, is that possible? [long]
01:15:02
That would give a linear ordering [short] of crimes [short] *uh* [short] in time and that's what I basically want to see. [long]
01:17:15
Yes, this is [short] what I was looking for. [medium]
Can you stretch these two visualizations [short] *uh* on the x-axis like just [short] pull the--. [long]
Yeah, yeah. [short] 
Yes, this is, this is fine. 
*Uh* [short] ok. [long]
Two, [short] three, [short] ok.
Experimentor: Just like a few minutes.
*Uh* ok, sure. [short] 
*Uh* *hm*. [long]
I just have a [short] concluding-- [short] *uh* [short] remark with-- with this [short] *uh* visualization, I mean [short] although [medium] I [short] have a strong feeling that they are both correlated [short] *uh* in the sense that [short] somehow either the data is being [short] *uh* duplicated in terms of two different crime-types [short] or [short] something else is going on there.
And, [short] *uh* [medium] this-- this view helps.
But [short] I'll have to look at a larger [short] *uh* [short] range [short] in order to make any conclusions on that.
So, yup. [long] 
*Oh* yes, [short] it was great. Thanks.
