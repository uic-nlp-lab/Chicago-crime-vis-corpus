START00:12:01 Ok well which, which of these four--, which of the, I-- I don’t know.I’d like to know which of the four [short] areas, *um*, has the highest incidence of, [short] *shoo* [short] homicide, battery, assault, [short] sex-offense, kidnapping [short], *um*, just I guess to know *um*, where to feel the most worried?When walking down the street, basically. And I would probably limit that to to the street [short] when you get inside the building [short] there is usually another security [short] situation there.experimentor: Excellent, and that--.Just interested yeah, because yeah, it would be nice, best to see like *um* yeah like kind of sort of a heat-map of of violent crime. [short] just to see that in general.Cause you always hear that, right? So you think [short] well xxx there’s a lot of money down in the Loop, so there is a lot less crime. [short]This is supposedly in a bad neighborhood where U_I_C is, it’s supposed to be a little dodgier, but I’ve never really experienced or felt that way.experimentor: Yeah, so *um* the expert is working on your first query. experimentor: I think you mentioned about heat-maps. experimentor: So once it’s generated, I think it will keep going.I think that’s the right term, I don’t know. *Um* I should know more about visualization then I do *um* but *um* its [short] interesting.That’s right, so what do we expect here?We expect there to be a--.experimentor: Yeah, so now *um* when it’s done processing, the-- I mean [short] when he or she is done processing the request-- *uh* you will see visualizations that show up on the screen.The-- in this little black screen xxx?experimentor: *Uh* no, it’ll be on the big *uh* it’ll be in the--.The whole thing is going to fill up xxx?experimentor: *Uh* yeah, I mean to the-- to an appropriate size. experimentor: But yes [short]. experimentor: So-- which is-- I don’t know if that’s good or bad, but that’s what it is.Well, it’s surprising-- prototyping a sort of [short] big thing.Thought you would go and--.experimentor: Smaller?Smaller-- smaller xxx this [short] scrambling to put things in xxx low, or. [short]experimentor: Well, look, we can definitely talk about it after the--.*Woah*, *oh* *geez* [short]. We only to the-- ok we get them all here.experimentor: And you can-- you can look at the title to get a hint of what that one-- what each one is showing you.Yeah, so theft [short].These are just the sums of crimes. [short]So total incidences, so now we are sort of like, ok.These are just raw counts [medium], I’m not sure we want raw counts. We want, *oh*-- *oh*-- *oh*-- what’s this?Crimes by region. [medium]So this is going to be the relative proportion. [medium]Ok so I guess, I’m curious what the scale is here. Is this just by by-- by-- by-- area? Or by number of people who live there? Number of people who work there?*Oh* working on a certain size by number--, these are just raw numbers. Yeah but down here, crimes by region. Ok, so this is just, of all the numbers of crimes, this is just where most of them are.So, Ok. [short]00:16:02Alright, but now. Ok I’m just, clear in the amount of this. The image down here seems to-- I can’t tell if this theft box for River-North is-- *oh*, I can move that, look at me.*Um* if this is theft box for River-North, I assume that the area for this [medium] is bigger?And how does area relate to [short] number [medium]? I can’t tell which one, is-- I think River-North is, what to me like-- River-North has got more theft. [short]I-- I’m having a hard time comparing sizes of this, so I’m back over to here.The bars are going to tell me raw counts [short] of theft [short] are highest [short] in River-North, where I work [short], *wow*.Battery [short] the worst is in River-North, but slightly. Assault [short], that’s funny, *wow*. Near-West [short] look by raw counts [short]. I don’t know, I feel like, yeah I think you can improve that visualization. [medium]I need to know [short] do you have any numbers about population [long]?Xxx population, we don’t know about population. Do we know about area?See, it’s not going to tell me-- it’ll actually tell me the opposite. Cause I’m assuming-- I’m assuming in River-North, and especially in the Loop, there’s just gobs of people with wallets.So I’m not too surprised you are stealing more of them, cause-- cause that’s where I would go if I wanted to steal.If I wanted to knock somebody over the head, and that’s also sort of consistent. So what’s the police presence in, and how do we measure that? [short]Do not have, what do we have?Ok, can we limit this to just by crimes that happen on the street? [medium]experimentor: It’s processing.Or do we not have that data or?experimentor: Yeah, if you look at the status.*Oh*, processing, ok [short].Man, I don’t know, it’s just this-- I am having a hard time equation, it’s like a pie chart [short] only less effective.Really what I want to know is where the concentration of people is.We need data on-- [short] looks like foot traffic.I mean, if I’m worried about the street, which is what I’m worried about.How many people are there that are potential victims here.Crimes in regions, just on street [medium].Near-West goes off the charts.River-North. [long]And we don’t have any data about where the police currently are?*Oh*, sorry do not have that data.Yeah, I guess I can sort of see how maybe you wouldn’t.Cause then criminals could look at that and know where to go. *Um* so we can’t really measure how effective, well really what you’d want is the kind of like the deployment of the police on certain areas and its effect on crimes sort of a gross, you know, Giuliani, is that Giuliani?Or you know, you crack down on the on the panhandlers and that supposedly had an xxx amazing ripple effect on all sorts of violent crime xxx.00:21:07 *Um* I don’t know what to do.I’m a little surprised [medium].So, I’m-- [short] I-- I feel I’m justified in feeling safer [short] walking around the Loop, I guess, all other things being equal, right?Ok, so the assumption is the Loop has a much higher population density, and it has the lowest-- [short] it has the lowest incidence of crime [short] of all these. So it wins, based on that, I’m thinking probably the Loop is not where I want my resources deployed.And [short], I’m kind of out of luck. I don’t go Near-West [short] *um* so that’s my mercenary interest here *um*. [short]Theft-- [short] ok well I’m-- [short] battery and assault. Well I don’t know, looks like Near-West and U_I_C, right?So, I would focus on Near-West and U_I_C, based on this-- *um* where I would deploy additional law enforcement resources.Which areas to deploy officers, which crime-types to target.Let’s see, well which crime-types to target, that’s [short] I-- I-- I just think harm to people, that’s a policy decision.I just think that people xxx steal, take-- take things, but don’t don’t hurt me.That’s-- [short] all these things are sort of bad. I mean [short] if I-- if I got mugged like six times, I would probably change my mind about how much I like my wallet.*Um* whether it varied upon time, depending upon time-of-day.Yeah well we-- let’s talk about time-of-day.*Um* can we get a range of time-of-day [short]?Like, I don’t know, some sort of-- like [short] I mean I would focus battery and assault.I think these things are, these other-- [short] these other bits are I-- I’m not concerned about the theft and I’m more worried about battery and assault.The other ones are too rare to even-- but I’ll tell you that murder line looks a little thicker for U_I_C.*Um* but yeah, I would-- why don’t we look at-- I-- I don’t know, I guess I would focus on Near-West and U_I_C and give me some sort of a breakup by time. [short]Make a decision about-- I’m focusing just on the two I think need resources, I think that makes [short] sense.I don’t know xxx problem. Yeah, I don’t see day-of-week, time-of-day, yeah I guess all of that is interesting.Xxx visualization xxx. [long]00:26:20By time-of-day, Near-West and U_I_C. [long]Midnight to 6-A_M, 6-A_M to midnight, three to 6-P_M [long]. People are asleep from midnight to 6-A_M xxx. U_I_C then looks [long] a lot different than you’d expect. The Near-West side goes down 6-A_M to midnight, that’s weird [long]. Xxx midnight to 6-A_M. [long]Wait this is all-- all crime-types and location-types, this is all crime-types and location-types.I don’t want all crime-types, I just wanted-- *um* I just wanted battery and assault. [medium]And I would actually throw back-- I would put-- [short] I would put River-North back up on the list. [long]How many violent crime [medium], that’s another thing it’s like you need-- in order to-- these are crimes that are [medium] crimes that are reported I assume. Do we have any data on [short] crimes that are solved? [long]That might also indirectly, you know, it would also indirectly tell you, give you a sense of where to not rob. [long]Midnight to 6-A_M [medium], there are more crimes from midnight to 6-A_M than there are from 6-A_M to midnight in the Neat West side. [long]Xxx [long] on well it’s getting their list.Xxx who you got looking for Near-- *um* atleast in this shows the pattern you would expect-- *um* seems to imply you you’ve won. [short]*Oh* wait, *oh* no wait a minute, this is not evidence here. This reinforces the pattern that did make sense.There’s more crime from midnight to 6-A_M than there is from 6-A_M to midnight.Ok well I guess I should expect xxx to drop, ok. 00:300:50*Um* and battery and assault are [short] probably things you are going to tend to not do in broad daylight. Theft is less xxx. So yeah, ok, so this is telling me we need more police [medium], between 6-A_M, between midnight and six, when people aren’t awake. [short]Police need to work at night and they need to work in--. [medium]They don’t need to work so much in the Loop *um*. [medium]Day-of-the-week, did we get a day-of-the-week. Times by-- time-of-day, times in region by time-of-day.These are just the same thing by time-of-day, this is still by time-of-day. Yeah, so-- so, day-of-week?Ok so can you do something with day-of-week [short]?Just same crimes, battery and assault, same crimes *um*. [short]Instance of-- be interesting to see if we could just xxx. [long]I really want to know about population density. [short]But yeah, for now *um* [long].Xxx wizard of oz.experimentor: huh?I think it’s one of those things where I think your xxx system is going to be [short] *uh* a lot better than than, it’s going to be faster than your first one.Because you think about some sort of keyword things to show stuff-- and also you can be sort of processing the person talking while your--.Wait, leave me alone, let me do this [long].*Eh* it’s fun, I-- I can see, I mean people would [short], people would like doing this. [medium]Date, week, [medium] boy. Grade is returning an s if 1500 change down to 1000. It’s still pretty significant, and more on the weekends [short].Particularly Sunday, [short] for whatever reason.So that seem to tell us there should be more police, not in, not necessarily in the Loop.Well atleast two neighborhoods, and probably that third neighborhood, third non Loop neighborhood, at night on the weekends.Well ok, well wait a minute, so we don’t know that.*Um* so, can I look at-- can I look at *um* by time-of-day and [short] on the weekend? [long]Well, it’s good that we’re all on one street we can begin with, because we are going to make the cops tour all night, on the weekends.All of them, but still the mass of the crime is during these-- these heavy spikes. [medium]00:35:30But it seems like you want to, yeah, you want to distribute your resource kind of in the shape of this-- of this curve. [long]What’s this? *Oh* yeah, well there’s the curve. Yeah, that-- [medium] that tells you that [medium] something happened. [long]00:36:57*Oh*, this is all crimes in the area [long].So it totally matters what-- which-- [short] it totally matters which crimes you want to solve.Cause if you throw everything in, you get this different picture.So that means, if you, if you look at the crimes you don’t particularly care about-- the picture will be skewed quite a bit from, from [short] what it is versus two favorite crimes. [long]Xxx Just battery and assault [long].So now, I've forgotten what I was even trying to answer.Battery and assault, and time-of-day.Well I guess we’re getting there, what we can get at here is the [short] xxx *uh*-- what are we getting at here? [medium]So, we still have this, we have this behavior on the weekend, where police have to xxx. [short]And we saw it in the overall data. [medium]Then we saw spikes on the weekend, did we?Can we ask questions like that?Ok, wait a minute, what did I just look at?Cause I’m feeling pretty good about-- about the-- let’s get these two neighborhoods, maybe that third neighborhood too, on the weekend and, and at night.I think the-- the data xxx that out.But now I’m thinking they want me to [short] point to some compelling visualization that makes that really obvious. [short]And I think we built sort of-- I think we have-- I think we have charts we can pick to do that.*Um* what we don’t have is. [medium]Ok we sort of identified a change in crime pattern, by time-of-day. We didn’t get it month-- month-of-the-year. [short]How could we-- *um*, ok where’s my *oh*-- did it get smaller? Xxx this-- this guys, so what can we do with this guy?*Um* to get at-- [medium] I want another dimension here that’s that’s like month-of-the-year [short].So, it’s almost like I want-- I want, 12 of 12 lines or 12 *uh* [short], I don’t know how you would visualize that.*Um* should do [short], yes, multiple visualizations, that’s what I want, I want multiple visualizations of this result.*Um*, I’m pointing to it, probably can’t see it, of this result *um*-- the the *uh* crimes in region by day-of-week, just battery and assault.Actually, yeah, all of this, with the bars or this thing.This looks like we really want, just kind of, the curve [short] to where to put, where to put the police. [long]00:41:30*Oh* I’m sorry, you need me to clarify. So the-- the-- so crimes in regions by day-of-week, just battery and assault.But I want to see, different, I want to see different lines for each month-of-the-year. [short]So then maybe if may--, if it gets cold, crime goes down atleast the cops can go where it’s warm, maybe take their vacations in the winter.Otherwise everyone’s going to s--, yeah, we can’t have all the cops quit because their hours are so terrible. [long]Well it’s getting worse enough, you're right.We’re just going to focus them on finding the people too, in case we didn’t arrest the people who aren’t going to shoot them.*Um* so [long] xxx. Cement gives it little crime hot-spots, almost seems like we could drill down by block.I mean, how big are each of these? [short]experimentor: xxx.They’re pretty-- they’re relatively big, so you could break this down by block.experimentor: How?Or I mean, I don’t know how. [short]Cop on the beach, right? So, cop has a-- I don’t know if that’s even how things work.I don’t know how many-- I mean, how much of a-- of an area do they-- does-- do they put them in?We need to make those things smaller, and put more cops in them.So probably this could be more targeted than just, you know, the neighborhood. Or--.experimentor: *Haha* it’s true.That might be what they-- [long] well, ok, actually when I first saw crime hot-spot I didn’t realize it’s-- it’s like, ok with crime we are going on, we are getting sort of like, what was even the timeline?*Oh*, this was all time. *Uh um* ok. We blew that off, we look at the trends in crime, in the-- *oh* my god, ok.So Sundays xxx.Just battery and assault, just U_I_C and Near-West. xxx *Oh* so this is just the weekend.Just weekend, just xxx. Ok, so this is just weekend, but it’s giving me Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday. [long] This doesn’t seem like it’s--. [medium]experimentor: Be-- becareful not to touch, just so you know.*Oh* this is the month, ok I don’t think this is not just-- just the weekends, looks like.Like, it’s every day-of-the-week, by month. [short]And are we seeing-- I mean this xxx so January, February, March, it’s colder, it does go up when it gets warmer, I can tell when it gets warmer.And it seems like we do get these sort of humps, but what is this one?experimentor: *Uh* don’t, don’t touch it, just saying.experimentor: Becareful not to touch, yeah cause it *um* it xxx.*Oh*, I’m sorry.experimentor: You-- you can ask to make it big or move it.Ok, well crimes in region by day-of-week, month-of-year [long]. I don’t understand this chart, [short] these both say just, ok this is-- *oh* ok, so this is-- the month is up there, ok.And this is giving me a very gentle pump, ok. [short]I don’t know, I guess I don’t understand this, the where--, where it’s just weekend here on the chart, because I got Sunday through Saturday. So, that’s not just the weekend. But all the information is there, it just seems like it’s for the whole week. *Um* [short], so what is that, *oh*, see this is more what I was thinking, yeah yeah yeah, ok.00:46:55This is giving me the Sunday through Saturday, we have the spikes up here, and then we can see the-- [short] we can see the worst months, yeah, you sort of lose the *um* [short]-- you kind of lose the [short] the dates.*Um* [medium] the months. There’s no logical, you know the color doesn’t really give you any sort of, I mean, the color doesn’t tell me whether it’s getting cold or not.Sort of could though, right?Seems like you could change the color scale on the 07-11.P_N_G chart [short], so that it would, you know, it would go-- go between, if we gave each month a color that’s not just random.Something like January, you know so February would be really dark blue, and we would range from blue to red or something.So the months by-- basically based on the average temperature of that month. [short]That’d be, *um*, just a processing issue xxx.But even that’s sort of-- I mean you’re still sort of-- I mean if this gives you-- well even this doesn’t. I mean this is giving you the number of crimes, I guess the other thing you can do is something, [short] well I don’t know, seems like you are always going to rely on color in some way to sort of stand for something.And I think blue to red, or, I mean there’s got to be some, [short] I mean that may be, I think that maybe that’s a cultural thing too, different cultures different-- but if you could f-- *um* I don’t know, man.That’s like a future [short] or you know, even if I can assign colors somehow, but I don’t want to t--, *oh* I’m not supposed to touch it, that’s the whole point, yeah.So yeah, kind of what you would say is like xxx, culturally sensitive *um* [short] ways of representing color.That’s *uh*, that’s got to be a topic on xxx, might tell you something.But I think I get-- I get out of this [medium] I mean, sort of confirms to me what it, what I was xxx [short].Ok, well this is using a single color scale *hm*-- no, that doesn’t really do it, cause see, like. [medium]I mean December is colder-- I mean, January is colder than December, right?It’s sort of like a thing that starts in-- [short] in spring and goes around till spring.So it starts, like darkest will be by august, and then it would get lighter, so like September, October, November, December, January pretty much. [medium]Then if you had that, you could sort of see, or what I would expect is that the cri--, the red-er would be at the top of this, and the the lighter shade would be at the bottom. [short]Does that make sense? [long] Yeah, might be kind of hard, I can see that being kind of [short] hard. But yeah, well, you know, so otherwise you’re [short] yeah, it’s-- it’s still better than it was before.00:51:04*Oh*, what’s that? *Uh*, not sure [short], not sure what that whole xxx.Still going January to December, from like, too dark.It needs to go from [long] what’s the coldest month?February, I think it is, in my mind, February will be the darkest, or the lightest, fine. [long]All I know is, December and January are next to each other.Anyway, so, I don’t know, seems like *uh* when is our meeting?experimentor: *Uh* it’s at 11:30.*Oh* good. *Um*, so-- [medium] I don’t know, I think we have enough to build on, to make some suggestions. The idea here, I mean I think what we are missing here is crime hot-spots.I mean, do you have data-- like, geographic hot-spot, do you have any data that breaks down the-- the neighborhood by, smaller divisions, I don’t know, blocks, or?You do? Great xxx. *Um, geez*, what was the worst neighborhood? *Um*, well I want to look into a neighborhood I walk through, U_I_C.So, let’s look at, can we look at the U_I_C neighborhood [short], and number of battery and assault cases by block?And there was the other thing I didn’t get at, is the-- [short] the trend.That’s really what I want to look at, right?So you want to look at the-- so you pick-- you pick your neighborhood, and you-- you pick your-- your trend and and then you-- you-- you put your-- I’m assuming resources allocated to the area changed over time, and see if there’s a correlation.I guess that’s more of an abstract question.Xxx that’s deploying *oh*, ok.Look at those hot-spots, there right there.So put a b-- cop on each one of these red dots and you’re done. [medium]*Wow*. [long] Xxx. That’s interesting [long]. We see xxx where most of the students are most of the time.It gets a little dodgier in xxx.So, I mean, I suppose there’s a general recommendation I think to push [short], you know, some more resources East xxx, the South xxx [short].*Um*, yeah I I like this response.*Um*, the only thing-- I-- I wanted to see the time break down. So I guess again let’s just stick with U_I_C from *uh* from [short] xxx four years xxx ten.Can you get me every six months? *Uh* crap, going to have like variations within the segment. Well, let’s just go by year, so can you get me annual-- *uh* the annual number of assault and battery cases [short] in [short] I don’t know. I guess just the U_I_C neighborhood for now.00:56:25But still I don’t know what that tells me.This got worse, well I don’t know what, I don’t know what the police response-- I mean what the-- the-- [short] well I don’t know, we’ll just know if things are getting worse or getting better.Somebody knows, what the xxx. [long]This is 2010 to-- be nice to what it was too-- I’d like to see what it was before 2008. [short]*Um* xxx. The run-up, if you had this for like a 10 year, or back to 2004.Let’s see, let’s see if crime just grew naturally, cause I know crime does. [short]People have jobs xxx.But maybe not for this type of crime.That that’s another thing xxx.Well ok, I guess you can say if conditions have been sort of getting better, so maybe it’s less xxx. So things are getting better, well that’s nice.*Um* [short] I’m just curious, do we show the trend for all crime?Yes we do, or yes you can do that for me?Can you show me the [short] xxx.Are you saying that yes-- yes, we do see the same trend or yes you-- you can draw me a picture of xxx.I’m assuming the latter.experimentor: *Ah*, yeah-- yeah, yes.*Uh*, can we see this this sort of hot-spot map by time [short]?What would that even look like?*Oh* well you could do an animation, I guess.Or you could do [short] if you type really fast xxx. [medium]It’d be curious to see yeah, even if if it was just a sort of animation that went month by month, or [short] then you almost got to go year, year by year controls for all the seasonal variation that you’ve already established over there. [medium]So, its, yeah yeah yeah-- yeah I don’t know. How would you-- that that-- that’s also kind of what you want cause like you, it’s like you know, I mean if crime goes down in in the winter I think people want to take their vacation xxx. Xxx perspective, it’s meaningful xxx.It’s almost like you want to [short] or you could do one for each month, I suppose [short].Well but also I would think actually the hot-spot wouldn’t probably vary by season, but the hot-spot, I’m assuming, you know, if you got crime, this is a particularly bad point on the map, it doesn’t matter what the weather is, relative to what’s around if that’s could probably retain it’s [short] it’s hotness xxx. [long]1:01:03So [short], ok so you just showing, *oh* ok so then we have-- we’re going to look at them when they’re all cold. [long]*Wow*, ok [long].It sort of confirms what this, this is a pattern, *oh* I see.Then it goes from 1 to 38, 1 to 34, 1 to 7, 1 to 58. [long]I can’t see the 2011, but anyway, so and, [medium] I guess what I would say here is like you’re-- you're *oh*, that’s not good. *Um* I guess all I was going to say about that is it’s sort of like akin to like the *uh* you know, people xxx if you got a bar-chart, people just lop off the bottom of the scale. So like you’re your’re basically-- yeah I mean you’re so-- so for these if you change *yup*, you had to keep the color scale the same.experimentor: Yes.Right? Cause like a red dot meant 27 crimes in one year and then a dark red dot meant 58 in another year, then the scale is different.So if this was like an animation you, I think you do want to see the overall, you know, tempering of crime over over time as it moves.*Um*, so that would be-- well that that’s what I would want. But I don’t think you-- you-- I don’t need to make that.END
