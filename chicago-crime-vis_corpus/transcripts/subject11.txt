START
7:33
Let's see. [short]
I should probably look at [medium] *uh*, the-- [medium] let's start with the activity around U_I_C?
7:55
*Oh*.
8:07
Let's see. [short] 
Is it-- [short] is it working?
Is it moving?
It's probably loading-- *oh* *haha*.
Just saying out my thoughts. 
It's processing, so it's working. [short]
This thing is [medium] all the-- sorting [short] so [medium].
Let's see, city is specifically aiming to deploy additional law enforcement [short] resources to combat and deter crime and need to know which areas to deploy the officers, *oh*.
9:03
*Oh*, there's two of them.
So many pink ones.
Let's see what it says here.
Heat-map showing crime hot-spots, all crimes only red.
So the pink means that it's more minimal, red means it's pretty hot. 
So we are looking around Harrison, Ashland, Roosevelt [medium] it's not that bad. 
Except towards-- closer to Roosevelt and South Canal, the heck's goin on around there?
*Uh* [short] and [short] Roosevelt and Ashland?
Ok.
9:50
Let's see what's this one here.
Heat-map showing crime hot-spots all crimes just U_I_C.
*Oh*, ok, this is what I'm looking for. 
The sum of number of crimes, I think [short] right? Yeah.
Again, pink is small, red is the hot-spot [short] *oh* [short] ok. 
What's this again?
That's all neighborhoods, this is specifically just U_I_C.
I'm looking at [short] Canal and Roosevelt. 
That one's really hot!
Wait what, what metro is that? That one right there.  That one is really really [short] red. I can't see with the [short] dots in the way though. What metro is that?
10:54
It's not neighborhoods.
Is it Jackson-- [short] Jackson Boulevard?
Let's see [short] can I alter this [short] *oh* ok.
*Um*, yeah, I want to take a look closer to the metro right here, *um*, a little bit eastward of Greektown. 
That's like, right by the river.
*Oh*, you can't zoom in. 
Ok, that's fine. 
Alright, cool, because that is a funky spot.
Crime's right there at the metro. 
At the EL-- I think-- wait no, EL, metro?
Am I getting these trains mixed up? 
I probably am.
*Um* [medium], but yeah, around U_I_C, we'll probably have to focus around Canal actually. 
Roosevelt's got its problems, but Canal's got its bigger problems.
Yeah.
12:25
Everything else is more dispersed. 
Ok. 
Yeah. 
So around here, around Canal-- *oh*! What is this? This is cool. 
*Haha*.
12:50
*Ahh*. 
More transparent, that's great.
Ok.
Adams [short] this would be-- what are those?
That's a bus stop.
Is it? Yeah.
Yeah, that's a bus stop. 
Ok.
A bus stop near [short] Greektown?
I'm not going to know the number of that. 
Unless there's a chance of zooming in.
Alright. 
Yep.
But that street is specifically Jackson Boulevard [short] I think?
No.
It's still Canal anyways.
Right next to the [short] freeway?
Yeah. [medium] 
Ok. 
So along around U_I_C, we're looking along Canal and Roosevelt.
So we want to do some routine searches through that [long] yeah. 
So that-- so it just seems like it's around the perimeter more. 
It's like a box of everything else, dots in the middle but we got most of it on the border.
Ok. So we go border-wise around it then.
That would definitely be [short] what we should do when it comes to the officers.
It's probably the smaller streets that does it.
No, it's all along the main ones, yeah, ok.
It's ok.
I think I got this one for U_I_C, where to deploy officers would be around the perimeter of-- [short] *uh* this looks like East-Campus.
Yeah.
I think.
Thank you.
Alright, then let's take a look at-- *uh* [medium] I'm curious about River-North? The activity around River-North and in it?
Yes. 
15:45
*Oh* it's shrinking!
This is so cool, look at it go.
Goodbye adult maps, you've become baby maps.
That one's a teenager. 
Alright.
*Whoa*.
*Uh* [short] it's not-- the dot's aren't as red, but it's definitely red around Chicago Avenue. 
So it's more focused around there, not surprised since that's like shopping and everything.
So nice place to break-in stuff I guess.
Often very populated so I'm not sure who has the guts to go doing that. 
Except, let's see, I spent an all-nighter once.
But around 4-A_M [medium] no. 
Let-- downtown trickles down around 3, and then everyone starts trickling in around 6. 
But yeah, definitely around Chicago Avenue, Magnificent-Mile [medium] keep calling it the Millenium Mile what the heck was I thinking?
*Ah*, let's see.
Wow, around the child-museum too? 
It's not as bad but it is orange.
It is a child-museum, I'd be concerned. A water-infiltration plant too, that doesn't sound healthy.
I wonder what's going on with Ontario and Ohio. 
Ok, ok. 
So let's see, if I were to deploy officers for here, I'd have to average them out for where things are more [long] going to likely get hit. 
So, I'd say [medium] *hm* [medium] get a few up there, we can go ziggy-zaggy down [medium] possibly. 
That Ontario spot is throwing me off, because I'd go zig-zag down, and then go to the right, make a little bit of a turn around the museum, because I'm always concerned about children, and then go [medium] back around.
Maybe there's another way I could compromise that, because this is like, *uh*, I am picking the best route to [medium] to send officers out, possibly on just a routine patrol, instead of, you know, go out on a hunt.
So [medium] ok.
Ok, hold on, wait, I think, *hm*, yeah, ok I think we got it.
We'd go, probably like *uh*, it'd look like a fire, a little flame, that'd tip up here, then we go down, go along, go down the Magnificent-Mile, and then Loop up back around.
Because, I think that child-museum is close enough to the Magnificent-Mile.
Yeah, ok.
So we go down, and around, and back up. 
So it's a Loop within the Loop. 
*Haha*, thanks.
Alright, so that's what I would conclude with. 
Let's see. 
And then I want to try the Loop. 
Thank you.
20:30
Bye bye.
Definitely going to need you for later, that's for sure, *hm*. 
20:48
*Oops*! 
Ok. 
Let's look at this. 
*Oh*! It's a freaking straight line right down there, what is going on with you state?
State you bad, you very bad. 
*Ah*, I think that's pretty much what we would probably do right there.
So, for U_I_C, I'm saying we do the perimeter, for River-North we'd do a Loop within it, over here it seems we go along State, because that's where it's concentrated, yeah.
Well that was a lot quicker than I thought, ok.
*Uh* let me see the activity for Near-West-Side. 
I feel so official, this is great!
Let's see. 
I have to look at crime-types later. 
And whether to do varied deployment depending on time-of-day, day-of-the-week, month-of-the-year. 
So right now I'm looking at a more general-- *blah*-- general kind of look.
And then, ok I can work with that. All the details.
*Whoa*, ok, what is going on with Wicker-Park?
Holy cow.
Ok, so we got some kind of parallelogram going on here.
*Oh*, it's just [short] that one line on the El. What El goes through this, through Wicker-Park?
xxx what is it with you, *uh*.
22:52
Let's see. 
What street is that? *Oh*, that's Damen! I drove through Damen!
Ok, so I can probably see the [short] setting.
Setting that looks very deteriorated, I will say. 
*Hm*, but we got a problem up on this line, a problem up on that line. 
The one up on West-Division, and the one up on, *hm*, the 64 it looks like. 
And then, we got a-- everything around it is pink and then we got *blah*, red dot. 
Wonder what happened there-- *eh*, might have to look at the details.
*Oh*, this is bad.
*Um* [medium] I wonder if I could look at just the general type of crime that occurs in Near-West.
*Ah* I could.
That might make my decision a lot better, because this one is [short] more spaced out.
So I'll look at that later. 
24:64 
*Hm*.
Ok. 
From this angle, if I compare just using Keller theory, I should be on the money with U_I_C.
Yep. And then [medium] over in River-North, it's pretty tear-droppy from my near-sightedness. 
I don't have my glasses on right now, but I should still be able to see very well. 
*Uh*, it looks like a diamond from near North-- Near-West. And the Loop, I cannot tell from over here, except the one freaking red dot I can pick out from the pink.
That's one thing I have to remember.
Can not drive without my glasses. 
Because how my eyes work without them, [short] is that-- [short] I see colors, which interpret into shapes, but I cannot see shapes specifically, so I imply everything.
*Oh*, ok.
*Oh*, *whoa*. Alright. Ok.
*Oh* yes, this is good too.
Lots of theft, battery is bad.
*Uh*, it's xxx, nice.
Well, ok, theft is very general.
Ok.
*Uh* [short] theft happens in all of them.
I'm not really too particularly surprised, because theft in general is, *um*, [short] well theft can range from stealing-- [short] stealing paper from the printer room to big old break-in.
That also includes trespassing.
Let's see, so, the Loop has problem with deceptive-practice.
Deceptive-practice, we talking like fraud or something?
Is that what deceptive-practice, ok. 
Ask the in-room aid [short] alright.
27:22
Hi, *uh*, when it says deceptive-practice, are we talking fraud?
experimentor: Yeah, basically, I mean-- if a business is claiming to do one thing, but it's actually doing something else, then [short] it's [short] you know, definitely being deceptive.
*Ah*, yeah, that is definitely fraud then. Ok, thank you.
Ok, so the Loop has fraud problems [medium] *uh*, ok.
Not too surprised [short] it is the bottom of the Magnificent-Mile, and not exactly the safest place, I think, right? No. I don't know. That's just me.
28:04
*Um*, Near-West [short] battery, criminal-damage, and burglary. Let's see how that looks.
Ok. Arson. What the-- ok. 
So, my look on the general [short] map and number obviously doesn't account for arson, because arson doesn't appear twenty times every-- everywhere, so.
*Uh*, hope I didn't-- let's see, right up there.
There is arson right there. 
And then [medium] deceptive-practice are-- I'm a little concerned about the arson. That's just, *uh*, that is, *whoa*, freaking sex-offense all the way on the bottom of that place, along Ogden what the heck's going on over there?
*Ew*w, ew nasty. 
*Uh*, let's see.
Ok, so Near-West has a lot of problems, but it seems the top 3 outside of theft is battery, criminal-damage, and burglary. 
And then everything else-- yeah. And then more theft of motor-vehicle.
River-North, has problems with battery, deceptive-practice, ok, yeah.
*Uh*, criminal-damage, ok. 
And U_I_C, battery, criminal-damage [medium] and then we got assault, deceptive-practice, and narcotics.
Which is almost as leveled as other offenses and motor-vehicle-theft.
Ok.
Alright, number of crimes by crime-type all neighborhoods, Lots of battery.
So do I want to, *hm*. 
No.
Arson may be really bad but it does come a lot more rare than the others.
So if we want to catch some we need to catch it for its frequency.
And the reason why there's a frequency is because of something within the areas, typically the settings and the culture within the areas. 
That's why I hear a lot of bad things about the West side. And U_I_C's like, *eh* it's ok. 
*Um*, let's see.
Yeah, arson's pretty bad, but that's like trying to catch a fairy every now and again. 
So we do-- if the officers do come across the arsonists [short] that's pretty cool [short] but we can't just focus on that.
So [short] I should-- [short] but, I should atleast give into consideration where the arson does happen, so it's more like the concentration of the area or the density of what kind of stuff that does happen, so let's see.
Down here we have sex-offense, we have some stalking, *uh*, death happens [short] too often for my taste. 
*Uh*, holy-cow what the heck? Ok, so prostitution up the wazoo here. 
*Um*, *eh*, stalking, ew. 
Is that, public-peace-violation, well-- that's more on the down low so definitely not something to think on.
Offense-involving-children, I will slap the person.
*Uh* [short] but [short] got to think on more [short] xxx.
Ok. And then [short] so lot's of sex-offense [short] around here. 
Arson's concentrated right here [short] and then everywhere else is [short] prostitution. 
Ok.
Lot's of them.
Ok, *um* [long] *hm*. [medium] What's the frequency of prostitution here?
Not too much, that's River-North, I wouldn't be too surprised, very little.
That's U_I_C campus, if there was any prostitution we'd be in trouble, trouble trouble trouble. 
Prostitution doesn't appear as much either, so I can [short] well it's not really in my book prostitution as a crime [medium] doesn't have the level of intensity as other things at the moment.
I have priorities.
33:44
*Uh*, yeah. So [medium] that's all the orange. 
I'd never do sex-offense honestly, no mi gusta.
*Uhh*, ok. I am totally going everywhere.
Why is it that that spot is a lot more-- it's a lot red-er? So that means it's more-- it's got a lot of crimes but the crimes, the number [short] is not compari-- it's not the because with [short] the type of crime.
Ok, that's what I am tryin' to say.
So it's more like we're looking up, it's like crescent almost going from near 64 further West and curve it down all the way over here. And then, what's this-- that's like a line of theft so I wonder what's going on there. [medium] 
Because like, prostitution seems like it's more focused here.
I mean, that southern border is nasty but [short] that's why we need to [short] patrol that spot.
So [short] we're around there, and back up, kind of like a G.
I think that'd be pretty good. 
Like a G.
Go around, up, and a little bit in. 
Because if we-- if we just leave the area [medium] like, not patrol, then that's where it's going to focus.
Because if you ain't looking there, then they're going to hide there. 
I would.
Let's see, [long] yeah.
So Near-West I would conclude that we'd do something-- hold on.
There's information for time-of-the-year [medium] for deployment. Could I take a look at [short] *uh* when crimes happen?
*Oh*, nice. 
And then I continue looking around here. 
There's a diamond there, but what happens there [medium] *uh*, that West side of Near-West [medium] that needs help. Yeah. Definitely a G there.
*Hm* [long] *haha*.
There it goes.
That's a good spot, because I'll still be looking at these.
It's always nice to have multiple screens up and available for me to look at [medium] because I like comparing things [short] if I'm looking for information.
*Oh* yeah, definitely. 
*Shrinkadink*, I love those. 
*Uh*, blue dots. Them blue dots not good.
*Hm* [medium], ok.
So looking at the time now.
Right now I'm kind of just looking at hot-spots. 
Significant changes in crime patterns.
Are we talking like [short] different settings?
*Hm*. 
37:59
Hello! Ok, where-- this spot [short] where it says that significant changes in crime patterns [short] *uh* [short] are we talking more like [short] changes due to crime setting or changes over time?
experimentor: *Um* [medium] I mean, it's up to you how you want to *uh* [short] what you're interested in, but I mean, I think in general [short] you know, changes in crime patterns meaning, you know [short] certain types of crime were low for a while and now suddenly they're high, or crimes that were high now suddenly they're low, like, what's changed, you know. 
Ok.
experimentor: So like, over time. 		
Alright, so.
experimentor: That's usually more closely, but you can, you know, you can interpret in other ways too.
Alright, thank you.
Alright, let's look.
We're looking at [medium] number of crimes per year [short] in all neighborhoods [medium] by per month.
So is xxx [short] decreasing [short] well that's good. At least we're seeing like a [short] slope down.
This is really wonky.
Down, from January [short] *oh* that's a holiday.
You're going to get a lot of tourists, so you're going to get a lot of people jipped.
That's really sad, but it is the truth.
Especially when they're new to an area, and they're very naive.
*Phew*, February, ok. Crimes per month-- Why is it February?
Is it because everyone's in the jewelry store?
I don't know. 
You don't know. 
Because like if there's more people there [short] then I don't know if you want to show your-- your mug there.
Yep. *Hm*. 
So, then it goes up [short] obviously during the warmer months because that's when everyone comes out.
But, August and [short] September [short] those two are specifically-- [medium] I forgot what the f-- no that's [short] there month after, they're close to the fiscal, I think, right?
It's either June or July I forgot.
*Um*, but there's definitely a time when [long] when the [medium] when children almost everyone who's pursuing education goes back to [medium] and then [short] if I'm talking more of the family unit, parents are at work, children are at school [short] around that time, or getting ready, so houses get broken?
I don't know.
Because like, number of crimes, a lot of these would account for theft, so I'm assuming a lot of these are for theft. Unless I could [short] look at them by [short] different [short] crime-types.
Like, individually, like *uh*, because I know theft is going to be big.
But I wonder how-- like when battery wants to take place.
That is great.
Let's do that. 
41:45
*Oh*, well, Friday.
My neighbors are noisy on Friday I have to call the guard to get them to shut up.
I'm not surprised.
*Oh* let's see.
*Hm*, number of crimes by hour-of-the-day. 
Yeah see, around-- wait no, what? 
They're more later than they are earlier?
I would've thought 3 to 6 in the morning. 
Because that's when nobody wants to go out.
So I guess these criminals are more-- I don't know, *uh*.
From 12 to, so from noon to evening. Noon is when they strike the most? 
Goodness, that's kind of scary.
43:17
*Hm*. 
43:42
Wait, [short] wait a minute. 
No noon would make sense. 
A lot of people would be out for sure but [short] it's not like they don't have no places to hide.
And then this when most people are too busy to do-- like focus on anything.
Well anything else. 
Ok. 
Let's take a look at this. 
Lots of deceptive-practice, yeah.
So funny. There's a [medium] *uh*, what is it, a xxx on the bottom.
Those are ok, yeah. 
Good god the number of sex-offense. It's pretty leveled out.
Deceptive-practice is pretty rotten.
Well yeah during the summer, that's when you try to get everyone. Everyone's out. Might as well knock them out in one blow.
From noon [short] till then, ok. 
Ok. 
Hey, would I be able to take a restroom break? 
experimentor: Sure, ok.
Would I need to remove this stuff?
experimentor: *Um*, yeah-- yeah you'll probably just want to, yeah, it'll probably be better, yeah, sure.
56:53
Alright, let's see where I want to send off the popo.
*Uh* hello.
Ok, let's see.
So everywhere seems to be [short] a lot of fraud. 
I wonder if that's like-- [short] that's a bad crime, but is it [short] the crime I want my cops to go after, or focus on?
Because there's a lot of other things, these just happen to occur pretty high, prostitutions after that.
This is by year, by day [medium] by day-of-the-week, ok. 
By year-- it's just nice to look and see that things are [short] getting little bit under control, which is nice. 
And then, by month. 
Only around the hotter days.
I'm also concerned about the children when they're heading back, so between June and September, be like a nice little increase of [short] stuff, of cop activity.
Just to match it. 
And maybe fluctuate a little. because once you become predictable, there becomes a problem and a fight. 
From noon, till almost midnight, which surprises me. 
Because I-- I just know [short] like in Pittsburgh, the streets are completely empty at 2-A_M.
So empty you can xxx right through it.
Ok, and then the end of the week, which I'm not surprised either.
That is what just [medium] the prostitution-- is just the beginning, so I guess it's like [short] from Thursday to Monday, it'd be nice to have those weekends increase of patrols or something.
During the day [short] mainly focus on [short] yeah see like till 3-A_M, that's prostitution.
You know what's going on around 3-A_M. 
Everything else kind of leveled out, that's why I'm not making a big decision on them, even though there's sex-offense, which I utterly, totally hate. 
But yeah, ok, just seems like, where am I going to find more mountains, because we're not liking these mountains.
9 o'clock has some weird spikes, what happens at 9? *Oh* wait, that's when everyone's in the street going to work.
And then the EL is like so [short] freaking [short] ew. 
Wait what's that second purple line again?
*Oh* wait that's theft.
*Oh* wait no.
Which one's theft?
Ok, *um*, no.
If I remember from the other charts, for one of those colors are way too [short] close, in [short] shade, unless it's the screen.
Which I can't tell.
No, they're the same shape.
*Oh*, Yeah, *uh*, is the lower of the purple the deceptive-practice, or is it the higher one?
Ok! Thank you. 
See, I detect-- I noticed the movement.
That's one thing, it's like having [short] a little bird come by and be like, hey look at me.
*Hm* [short] I'm starting to think I got the routes [short] West side I do.
I got to look at the other ones later.
But I want to determine on times-of-day [short] theft happens a lot [long] from what the other graphs say.
So I'm wondering if the top purple line is theft [medium] because then it'll match the information on the other graphs, but I'm not always sure?
01:02:21
Because like, what's the-- *uh*, no [short] a lot of these colors are similar or the same.
That might be troublesome.
Because like [short] I was kind of interpreting that this-- the fraud was like, so high that [short] everybody was doing it.
I mean I know I did it as a kid.
*Oh* there we go. That helps a lot better.
So it wasn't the sex-offense, it was the criminal-damage.
Yeah, labeling definitely does help, yes, ok.
*Uh*, gambling. 
Ok, concealed-license-violation, non-criminal, all that stuff. Happy days.
Ok, so theft occurs when everybody is out, especially at 9-A_M when everybody is out.
Because that's when you're booking for the train.
Midnight [medium] I guess.
Wait, midnight? 
Yeah, because I was thinking more between 3 and 6 but is it because we got more cops out around that hour?
Or is it [short] what is going on between 3 and 6?
Because everyone else's schedule is like I'm going to sleep at 2 and waking up at 7, atleast that's mine.
*Hm*, ok. So at 9-- *whee*. Ok, at 9, then at noon, what happens at noon?
Well that's lunch hour?
It's definitely rush hour. 
Ok, *oh* my god, theft between Friday and Saturday.
Glad I'm home between those times.
I'd probably-- [short] I don't know-- Pillow fight the thief?
Maybe.
*Um*, let's see. Just got to make sure I have this-- [short] there's still a green light, ok. 
01:04:58
I don't want to-- *uh*, ok.
February dips down [short] again.
Such a weird-- for it to dip down.
Especially because there's Valentines Day, there's Black History month.
What else happens in February?
Something else does, I don't know, I can't remember. 
Ok. So if I-- for specific months, I would focus from June-- wait no, hold on.
Where would spikes be?
That's what-- that's one thing I didn't notice.
The amount is pretty high but they suddenly grow?
Where are the spikes coming, between February and March [medium] for this.
Got to find spikes, that's why the 9-A_M was so weird for me, because spikes.
Let me do the last two, ok done.
That's great.
I'll-- I'll have labels now. Thank you.
This is very helpful.
Ok [short] so I don't really need the year anymore, because [short] from the looks of it, we're doing something right, and it's [short] heading down.
Just hoping that 2015 doesn't spike, because you know, graphs, numbers, weird.
*Um*, from midnight to 1 has a weird drop, but 9-A_M definite spike, 12-P_M definite spike, towards the evening when everyone is going, is heading home.
Because you hear a lot of stories of people heading home and finding someone has busted in.
*Uh*, 1700 hours, that's 5-P_M, so then [short] ok.
So 5, noon, and 9, but definitely between noon and 9 have a steady patrol.
But 9 is really, really off. 
So definitely at 9, send out cops. 
Right at 9, so I can get on the EL pretty safely.
01:07:40
Why am I looking back at the years, it's always nice to see things drop.
Is that weird to spike on February?
*Oh* yeah, bye-bye year.
I'm good with the year, thank you.
*Um* [medium] spike from February to March.
What happens between February and March, besides Valentine's-Day?
Or is it because of Valentine's-Day that it happens.
Wait, do stores have sales right after Valetine's Day?
Kind of like how chocolates get sales?
I see you typing! 
*Ah*, let's see. 
*Hm*. Smiley face! Ok.
Ok, so from February to March, I would say we need something to patrol that, or maybe between January to March, because [short] January still has that [short] no it decreases then.
Ok, yeah, yeah, yeah, February to March then.
February to March [short] starts increasing around May. 
But it is generally averaged around June to the end of September-- wait no, till mid-October.
Because that's when the weather's nice and you aren't drowning in snow.
So, alright, for day I'm saying [short] 9 [short] noon-- [short] 9 noon to 5.
For month [short] February to March, and then [short] June to mid-October.
Because of the [short] whole like [short] it's up there. God, that spikes so weird.
And [short] from Thursday [short] till [short] from Thursday till Sunday [short] weekend patrols.
So weekend patrols-- [medium] weekend patrols 9-A_M because it's the rush, 12 to 5 because of the work hours, is that why?
Or is it the rush hour, it's one of them, something like that.
February to March because of that weird spike [short] that concerns me.
*Um*, that's theft too, so a lotta of people are getting things stolen.
So I think I got-- I got-- settle-- I'm settling the time, yeah, I'm good on the time.
01:10:54
And I got-- [short] I got the G pattern I got for Near-West.
So let me see the crime-- what kind of crimes happen [short] around U_I_C. That map.
Because I'm done with the year, I think I'm done with the time, so.
Ok. Whoo, it's bigger! 
Alright. So is this the one you mean?
*Oh*, this is really helpful, because I need to compare, but it's much like I was doing with West-Side, I would like the crime-types with the crime activity.
Yep.
Thank you.
01:12:04
It's a ball bouncing.
Interference with public officer [short] ok.
Excuse me.
experimentor: Yes.
Ok, theft and burglary, *uh* [short] is burglary like more of the whole with trespassing?
And theft is like more, aggressive force or something? 
experimentor: *Um*, theft is [medium] is like you-- like let's say you take someone's iPhone without them knowing, you know, that's like you've [short] stolen that. But burglary's more like *uh*, [short] you're at someone's property and you're taking something [short] while threatening them and so on. 
*Oh* ok!
experimentor: So there are-- there are usually, you know, yeah.
Yeah. 
experimentor: There's usually the element of some type of threat that is there as well. Yeah. 
Alright. Thank you.
Because I had just noticed that. 
Doesn't change too much atleast. 
01:13:50
I just U_I_C.
Could I have like a hot-spot map, like *uh*, kind of like that colorful one for Near-West side with the blue dots too?
Thank you, I shall take a look at these, by the hour.
*Um*, just U_I_C.
9 [short] theft, that's when everyone comes in.
*Hm*, is that one for U_I_C too?
No, I don't think so, that one's general.
Ok, yep, that's because that one's 9-1, that one's 10-2, so 10-1's also connected, and then 10-3 and 10-4.
I'm good at picking these things up. 
Alright, this is great. 
Ok, so what we got here. 
We got [short] theft and [short] I think [short] sex-offense, right?
It's very [short] I don't know, it's very spread out.
That's pretty tough to make a decision on, and probably I'd still say perimeter-- wait.
There are some arsons, but arsons aren't as frequent as the whole.
*Oh*, thank you, there we go.
Now random green dots, Arson arson arson [short] arson arson. 
*Oh* wait, it's either-- that can't-- that can't be prostitution, because the map, ok it's the battery. 
There's got to be something done with those colors, because it mixes me up.
Especially because there's two different categories right there, *hm* *oh*.
Let's see, [medium] ok, and then down here.
Lots of battery in the middle [short] sex-offense and criminal-damage.
Ok let me look at this [short] criminal-damage, day-of-the-week.
Ok, so that's more criminal-damage than it is sex-offense.
Ok I woulda been really alert there [short] because I'm a woman. 
A lot of criminal-damage is right [short] there [short] and that's the medical district.
Ok, and let's see beyond there. 
I thought it's supposed to be just-- just these campus, but I'm reading maps wrong. 
*Um*, ok, medical, east, all around, we still got this funky stuff in the middle. 
So where would I want to route this? 
01:17:45
I said around the perimeter last time.
Do I want to stick with that?
Do I want to stick with that? 
I would say so more-- but [short] instead of going black and white on this decision, we'll go around the perimeter [short] but have a few that goes through the center.
Because it'll-- it's-- *ah* [short] arson appears more around the perimeter, so that's more like, you know, you need a bit ore force for that, but the center [medium] could do with like several cars, maybe a couple.
But not as intense as the others. 
Because it is-- [short] it is populated with students.
And the big thing you want to make sure is the students are safe, especially if you have a department for U_I_C specifically.
Because that means the department could just take care of it, because if the students aren't safe it's on your head. 
*Um*, yeah, ok, so around the perimeter more concentrated for patrol, but we should let some things slip in the middle in order to keep an eye on things in the center, because I'm not seeing more arson there, I'm seeing more [short] what I would say [short] *uh* [medium] crimes that require less force to apprehend.
Something like that. 
Let's see, day-of-the-week. the weekends.
Ok, yeah so continue with weekend patrol.
Tuesdays are a little weird, but it's not as weird as [short] the weekends, so yeah.
And then the hours, 9, freaking 9, 9 and noon until 5. Times still stay the same, freaking weekends.
*Oh*, I'm looking at the wrong one? 
Ok here we go, 9.
9, noon, it starts to drop at 5, so more of 9 and noon concentrated here.
That's right, right, yeah that's right.
Ok, still on the weekends, and I would still assume [medium] summer months because that's when everyone is out.
Yep.
*Um*, could I take a look at 10-3?
experimentor: Actually I think we'll, *um*, start wrapping up, I mean just finish up what you're continuing with.
Ok. I think I have a general conclusion atleast.
experimentor: Sure yeah, yeah, you can continue to look at 10-3, I think you were looking at that, maybe start wrapping up after that.
Yep, but I think, yeah, alright, yep.
So if I wanted to deploy officers [medium] it'd-- it almost seems like the whole city needs to be watched over for weekend patrol.
At least those four neighbourhoods specifically.
01:21:25
And then during those hours, 9-A_M especially because of the rush [short] *uh* [medium] noon till 5, because I don't know what's going on at night.
Apparently criminals aren't wanting to come out at night instead.
During the warmer months and February, till March, because that's always weird, ok.
Alright, yeah, so, I think I've concluded for atleast two of the neighborhoods I'm more confirmed on, because I've looked at all of the maps, which was really helpful.
It took a lot to decide because I'm jumping between stories and that's--.
experimentor: No it's good that's great.
*Oh* you were of great assistance.
