START
6:07
Ok, so, *um*, I guess [medium] I guess I-- I'm interested in-- in *uh*, mainly like if I was walking [short] from-- [short] if I was walking to the C_T_A-train, [short] if I was walking to the EL, *um*, would there be any areas that are particularly dangerous to walk through maybe, *um* *uh*, theft or battery or *um* [medium] that sort of thing.
7:57
Yes I did. 
9:20
Ok so I can see [short] all the crimes here, and [short] theft, battery, and assault [short] over there.
And I can sort of [short] I kind of know where the C_T_A trains are so I can kind of look *um*, and it looks like downtown, downtown's pretty heavy. 
So maybe like the Red Line is not super good. 
But [short] but outside of downtown it doesn't look so bad.
That's kind of what I'm seeing from [medium] these images. 
10:19
*Oh* and maybe that there's a bunch of [short] like, drunk people [short] *uh*, out by where the cubs play. 
The battery number seems kind of high up there. 
Ok. 
So I guess the next thing I'm wondering is [short] *um* [short] so the neighborhoods-- [short] of the neighborhoods [short] which one-- [medium] which one might have like [short] the least amount of [short] like, personal property theft like breaking into an apartment or stealing my stuff or *um* [short] all that sort of stuff?
13:16
Ok.
So it looks like [medium] they're all [short] pretty even.
Maybe Near-West-Side [short] not so great.
Maybe River-North not so great.
They're all pretty comparable though [long] is what it seems to me.
You would think from its reputation that River-North is less bad but [short] doesn't really look like it.
Cool. 
Ok so my next question is-- [short] is are-- [medium] are *um* [short] currency-exchanges and liquor-store-- liquor-stores as sketchy as they seem?
17:47
Ok. 
*Um* ok, so *uh* I can see the [short] the type of place crimes by location [short] *um* on the streets seems the most-- [short] definitely the most frequent or inside building.
*Um* and then [short] *uh* [short] theft is the most common of all [short] and then the other ones [short] *uh* and then the currency-exchanges [short] *uh* definitely being sketchy is still pretty high up there.
*Um* but doesn't seem to be [short] too physically dangerous, so that's good to know. 
*Um* [short] Ok.
So my next question is *um* [short] it seemed like when I used to take the bus a lot that in the summer [short] it was worse-- it was worse in the summer *um* [medium] *um* so I'm wondering [short] around the bus lines or on the bus *uh* if there are-- [short] if there's more public intoxication or fighting or [short] *uh* verbal harassment *um* [short] in [short] in summer months?
22:44
Ok so it looks like *um* [short] starting with all crimes that [short] absolutely in the summer there's an increase of crime.
*Uh* [medium] which [short] mostly continues through-- [short] continues through *uh* [short] with the bus stops [short] *um* I guess when it's not winter the buses are a little more sketchy. 
And then, [medium] *oh* I bet October has more problems because of Halloween. 
*Um* but yeah looks like, surprisingly May, June, July don't have as many, that's interesting. 
I bet March and November are because of holidays involving alcohol. 
Alright. 
Very interesting.
*Um* [medium] ok the next thing I was wondering about [short] *um* [medium] is *um* [medium] I think I would like to know the most frequent areas of sexual-assault among these neighborhoods. *Um* [medium] and a lot of people [short] I think are worried about public places but [short] *um* [short] the list also include private residences so [short] I think that's something I would like to know?
26:25 
Ok so *um* it's very clear that *uh* private indoor buildings are [medium] the most dangerous places for sexual-assault or most frequent. 
*Um* i'm a little bit alarmed about [short] hospital buildings being above bar.
*Um* a little alarmed by that, but *um* [medium] it's good to see this information, it's pretty clear. 
*Um* [medium] ok, *um*, my next question I'm wondering about *um* child safety *um* generally [short] *um* [short] you know if I was a police officer worried about children I'm wondering [short] maybe what times-of-day *um* I would like to focus-- [short] focus on and-- [short] and maybe you know, if this is near the school or closer to home, *um* I don't know if that makes any sense?
Great. 
30:24 
Ok, so I can see by time-of-day [medium] *um* the number of crimes involving children?
And [medium] I think [short] number of crimes-- [medium] I'm not sure how to read the [short] *oh* I see ok, I see.
*Uh* the times [short] *um* [short] I guess it's [short] hour 1 going on, ok. 
So mostly after school [short] and surprisingly midnight? 
*Uh* [short] that's a little scary. 
*Um* [short] it's mostly after school which I suppose one would not expect.
*Oh* I see there is this other graph that is much easier to read. 
*Um* [medium] yes absolutely after school. 
*Um* [medium] and again, it looks like [short] most things are happening [short] in private residences [short] and on the street.
*Um* [short] can I see the map [short] a little closer?
Thanks.
32:36
I think if I knew where the schools were I would [short] be able to read this a little better but [short] it tells me what I asked for so that's great, that's ok. 
*Um* [short] great. 
Looks like the Near-West-Side is a little more [short] heavily-- *eh* it's a little even I guess. 
Ok [short] *um* [short] so over-- over the [short] course *uh* the time period that the data set exists *um* has there [short] have there been changes *um* [short] changes in crime *uh* [short] I guess my neighborhood has-- have neighborhoods *um* experienced *uh* trends in crime over the course of the data set *um* I mean not [short] not all of the crimes but *um* [short] we're mainly focused on [short] robbery [short] and *um* [short] murder probably [short] would be one-- homicide, *um*.
*Uh* yeah, homicide, theft slash robbery.
37:59
Ok so it looks like [short] *um* [short] it looks like most crimes going [short] has a downward trajectory towards the current-- [short] over the course of the data over the last five years.
*Um* [short] *um* in all of the neighborhoods [short] *um* [medium] for all of the crimes though, looks like [short] well for homicide there are [short] so few in these neighborhoods that [short] I can see how the data could be up and down, a little bit.
But overall looks like everything has gone down, which is great.
*Um* [short] so my next question is [short] *um* when you take the C_T_A, they say there is no gambling on the C_T_A. My question is, is there gambling on the C_T_A?
42:40
*Ah* there were only 2 [short] well [short] I guess that's some gambling on the C_T_A [long] but the other types of [short] crime on the C_T_A are sort of what I would expect, but there aren't an awful lot of them.
Very nice, *um* [medium] gosh.
*Um*, ok near U_I_C [short] *um* or maybe we had already answered this question, *um* but near U_I_C what's the-- [short] *uh* [short] I guess the-- [short] the most [short] common-- [short] literally like what's the most dangerous-- [short] dangerous thing and place at U_I_C, in the U_I_C area?
46:10
Ok *um* [short] so looks like walking around outside is the most dangerous around U_I_C. 
*Um* [medium] and [short] I'm giving my-- the most frequent thing that happened, I can see on the map that there are certain [short] *uh* [short] certain areas that have more crime than others. 
*Um* [medium] sort of south of Roosevelt and [short] near Western *uh* and on the downtown side of U_I_C. 
*Um* [medium] ok [long] ok. 
*Um* [long] I'm trying to think of what else to ask. 
48:13
What types of crimes are happening [short] *um* so I'm looking at this number of crimes [short] display and *um* I'm wondering on the street and sidewalk what kind of crimes are happening at U_I_C?
51:02
Ok so, starting on the left I can see [short] *um* [short] the types of crime [short] *um* on the street and sidewalk, though I'm sure there's a law enforcement definition of those things that *um* [short] as a lay person I don't necessarily offer distinction, *um*. 
I don't know, they're [short] the things you'd expect, assault and burglary, *um* [short] criminal-damage is awfully high. 
There's a lot of different things that happen on the street. 
*Um* [short] and then I can see [medium] *um* [short] this figure [medium] not-- [long] not super clear on figure 10-2, though I can see it's divided in-- [short] into street and sidewalk and types of crime. 
Is it a map?
Ok, ok.
So again, much more [short] much more *uh* yeah. Lots of theft, lots of theft. 
Ok. *Um* [short] continuing on the theme *um* [short] *um* I guess let's choose-- [short] let's choose the most [short] frequent *um* [short] the top one seems like [short] *um* [short] well, let's see. 
*Um* I'm wondering basically are there-- is there days of the week [short] *um* or days of the week you know weekends versus weekdays *um* where [short] *um* these sort of common crimes that are around U_I_C are more or less?
55:56
Ok so *um* [short] it looks like it depends on the crime [short] sort of [short] base range for the [short] least frequent crimes *um*, *um* and [short] a slight increase in [short] some of the more *um* [short] the middle ones better in criminal-damage it looks like, weekends a little more [short] and that *uh* people like to steal things on Fridays.
*Um* [short] so [short] yeah [short] starting Friday night a little more crime in U_I_C. 
Ok [short] I imagine that would be useful. 
*Um* [long] I have to think of another question. 
*Um* what types of-- [short] what types of violations are-- [short] or crimes are being committed around *uh* places of business, like small businesses or grocery-stores or gas-stations, *um* [short] that sort of thing.
1:02:07
Ok I can see by far again [short] *um* theft is the most frequent [short] type of crime. 
*Um* [short] and I can see that by different places of business [short] *um* the [short] differences.
*Um* [long] *um* that's a lot of different businesses. 
*Um* [short] but I can clearly see the-- [short] the different places of business and the number of crimes and what type of crime, that's very interesting.
*Um* if I wanted to go back to-- *um* [short] we looked at number of crimes-- [short] different number of crimes by day-of-the-week, I'm wondering how this varies by neighborhood.
1:04:40
Ok so *um* [short] all crimes [short] in the different neighborhoods [short] *uh* vary by day-of-the-week, so it looks like [short] River-North really goes nuts starting on [short] Friday [long] and [short] and there is some difference among those neighborhoods. 
The Loop has overall lower crime [short] great! 
*Um* [short] I'm--I'm getting low on questions. 
Ok! Ok. Yeah. 
Yep, I'm all set! Thank you!
