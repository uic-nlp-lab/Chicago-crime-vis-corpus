Hi, so [medium] can you like tell me where [short] the [short] crime-rate is maximum? [long]
12:05
Ok. [long]
Ok, so, do the right one indicate the maximum-- it's the hot-spot? [long]
12:23
Ok. So [short] do these red spots indicate that it is a hot-spot of crime? [long]
*Ah* ok, got it. [short]
12:40
Ok. [short] So [medium] *hm* [short] which is the safest area, according to you? [long]
Ok. [short]
That's great. [short]
13:02
experimentor: Yeah, just, *uh*--.
experimentor: Number 2.
experimentor: Briefly explain what you see as you're--.
Ok--.
experimentor: Going through, you know each time.
Ok, got it. [short]
13:09
So [short] yeah, I can see. 
What is this area called?
I mean, I'm not familiar with the map that much so.
experimentor: *Uh* you can, you can communicate with the data analysis expert if you have any questions on--.
Ok--.
experimentor: On any of that stuff.
13:22
So, according to my understanding, I think the West Randolph Street has the maximum crime-rate and I guess [short] somewhere near Pearson Street [short] the crime-rate is maximum.
Well, and it's uniformly distributed all over, so. [short]
So [short] during what time is the crime-rate maximum?
During what time is the crime-rate maximum, during the day or the night? [long]
14:22
Ok. So [short] the crime-rate is maximum between noon and 6-P_M. [short]
That's surprising. [short]
Ok. [short] 
Good. [long]
14:47
So, according to you, which areas [short] do I deploy the officers? [long]
16:43
Ok, so the crime on the streets is the maximum. [short]
Ok, and [medium] the crime is maximum in River-North.
Fine, ok. [medium]
So [medium] ideally, I'd think we should be deploying more officers near River-North [short] and maybe near U_I_C [short] and Near-West.
Ok. [medium]
Ok, well, the response is great. [short]
17:24
So, what kind of crime is [short] what kind-- what kind of crime is maximum? [long]
18:22
Ok. [medium]
So [short] according to you theft-- [short] theft is the maximum, the biggest crime.
Ok. [medium]
So [short] is this collectively from all the areas? Or, a particular area? [long]
19:24
Ok, so, the River-North has the maximum number of theft.
Ok.
Followed by the Loop. [short]
Fine.
Ok. [medium]
So, I think that we should be deploying the officers near [short] River-North?
Ok. [long]
19:57
So which month has the maximum number of theft? [short] Or any other crime? [long]
21:22
Ok. [short]
So [short] June and July have the maximum number of crimes [short] and the least number of crime are in February.
Ok. [short]
*Uh* alright.
Yes, the response is quite good. [long]
Ok. [long]
22:01
So, according to your analysis at what point in the day is the crime-rate maximum? I mean the time, is it 3 o'clock, 4 o'clock? [long]
23:13
Ok, so-- [long] ok, so, the maximum number of crimes happen during the noon?
Ok, so it's basically between 12 to [short] 8-P_M? [short]
Ok.
Ok. [short]
This is great.
The response is great. [long]
23:51
So how many crimes have occurred at a particular residence or [short] residential area? [long]
25:46
Ok, so [short] around 13000 crimes occur in residences.
Ok. [short]
The response is good. [long]
26:05
So [short] are there any incidence happening on the C_T_A-train? [long]
27:02
Ok. [long]
27:11
Ok, so [medium] approximately [short] 3000 number of incidence have occurred on the C_T_A-train.
Wow, ok. [short]
Ok. [short]
*Hm*. [short]
So [short] is there any particular location where the crime keep on repeating? [long]
27:41
Ok.
*Uh* I mean to say that [short] is there a particular hot-spot where the crimes keep on happening. The same kind of crime keeps on happening, at a different point of time but the activity keep on happening. [long]
30:56
Ok, so, somewhere near [short] the River-North and the Loop [short] the incidence keeps on repeating and [short] and during 2011 [short] it's-- it's more-- more or less, the same place. [short]
Ok. [medium]
Ok, in 2012 and 2013 and 14. [short]
Ok, so according to my analysis the crime is happening, the maximum crimes is happening at around the same location. [short]
Ok.
Yes, the response was good. [long]
31:57
So, according to you, is the crime-rate increasing for you or decreasing? [long]
32:54
Ok, so [short] the crime is decreasing.

Ok, so, what do you mean by non-criminal? [long]
52:39
So Abhinav-- 
experimentor: Yeah. Thank god non-criminal, it *uh* more or less is more specific to [short] you are violating *uh* like *uh* city ordinances-- ordinances.
experimentor: You know, there are some ordinances by the city but they're not, but you're not really breaking a--.
Ok.
experimentor: A law doing it, you know.
Ok.
experimentor: You know it's more really like that.
Ok, like I'm breaking a traffic rule or something?
